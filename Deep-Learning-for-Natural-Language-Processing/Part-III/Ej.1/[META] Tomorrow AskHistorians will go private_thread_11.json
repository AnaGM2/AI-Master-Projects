    "description": "A few days ago we shared a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/) outlining our thoughts around API uncertainty. The tldr: changes negatively impact our ability to moderate. These changes are part of a larger pattern in which Reddit’s leadership has failed to support what [we believe is one of its greatest assets](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk2l9q/). Basically, our primary responsibility is making sure Reddit users are getting the best answers to your questions about history and Reddit is making that harder to do.\n\nWe understand Reddit’s need to change and evolve. For all we may harp on Reddit’s flaws, we do want to see it succeed! After all, we wouldn’t exist without it. So, if we’re expecting Reddit leadership to listen to us, we should be willing to work with them. In the days following the publication of the post, we discussed as a team what the specifics of working with Reddit would look like so we could clearly articulate it to you. We decided that compromise means: \n\n* Updates to the API are not tied to a particular date but are, instead, rolled out once the roadmap shared [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/) is successfully achieved.\n* Accessibility tools such as screen readers are part of the native Reddit infrastructure.\n* Updates are made across Android and iOS.\n\nWe think slowing down is the right thing to do. It would minimize further disruption while also generating an income stream for Reddit. \n\nThe AskHistorians’ mod team members are, functionally speaking, Reddit super-users. We have collectively invested thousands of hours into building our small corner of Reddit into a subreddit that is viable, trustworthy, and valuable, as well as something bigger. There’s our [podcast](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/podcast), academic writing [by us](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-229X.13259) and [about us](https://t.co/KgJvmwgUAu), and our reputation as, \"good history eggs on the internet.\" We’ve hosted two [conferences](http://www.askhistorians.com/2021-digital-conference), a [long series of AMAs](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search/?q=flair%3AAMA&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) and presented about AH at [other academic conferences](https://askhistorians.libsyn.com/askhistorians-episode-145-askhistorians-at-aha). We even won [an award](http://twitter.com/INKEproject/status/1615521900469305344?s=20)! Major outlets have even covered [our approach to moderation](https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/the-askhistorians-subreddit-banned-holocaust-deniers-and-facebook-should-too.html). We take all of this very seriously.\n\nNearly every time Reddit has asked for volunteers, we’ve stepped up. AH members help with the Moderator Reserves project, sit on council meetings and phone calls, host Reddit administrators who want to shadow moderators, and participate in surveys. Due to our commitment to the subreddit, we’ve built positive relationships with many admins who have been open to our feedback. But over the last couple of days—most notably during [Spez’s AMA](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/)—it’s become clear to us that Reddit’s leadership is not interested in finding common ground; rather, it seems to us like they're hell-bent on pursuing a course that damages us and them alike.\n\n**We feel we are left with no choice but to join the protest. On June 12, starting at 7am ET, we will take our sub private. We will remain private on June 13 as well.**\n\nWe’ll open the sub again on June 14th but will pause participation. This means you will be able to access existing content, such as the [Trans History Megathread in Celebration of Pride Month](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/141fhrs/trans_history_megathread_in_celebration_of_pride/), but will not be able to ask or answer questions. We will be delaying or holding off AMAs, limiting our newsletter, and will not be recording any new podcast episodes. As of today, we do not know how long this pause will last.\n\nWe cannot put this letter out into the world without thanking you for the immense support you’ve shown us over the last week. We’ve received support across platforms, in public and in private. We’ve been a community for nearly 12 years and that would not have happened without you and our other 1.8 million subscribers. We know we’re not the easiest community to post in, and deeply appreciate the people who ask dozens of thoughtful, rule-abiding questions every day, the people joining in on April Fools Day, those who anonymously report trolls and low effort answers, support the podcast via Patreon, and those who provide honest, thoughtful feedback on how we’re faring in general. We don’t take lightly the idea of shutting down this place and the community that we all build together, and we understand how frustrating it will be to not be able to find out, for example, [why GPS is free](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/13y7ee7/why_is_gps_free/). \n\nWe are all, at heart, historians. Studying the past requires a fair amount of optimism and confidence in humanity and as such, we are hopeful and confident a resolution can be found.",

The Reddit directors and CEO have shown themselves to be utterly disconnected from, and even disdainful of, their user base and the volunteer moderators who sustain this site. This is the source from which ALL of the value of this site — economic and otherwise — derives. It needs to be made clear to them, in no uncertain terms, that their efforts to produce more golden eggs for future shareholders are going to kill the goose if they are not careful. They need to seriously reconsider their business direction and choices. The users and the moderators _are_ Reddit. Not the directors. Not the CEO. Not even the code. A social website without users is an empty husk, just like a university without professors and students would be. These businesspeople need to take the attitude that any profits on this site need to be made by improving what works about it, not making it worse for users. If they can't find a way to do that, they should get into another line of work.",
