            "body": "Really, your question answers another commonly asked question: why didn't the Fellowship fly to Mordor with the Eagles? Simple. They were writing and recording one of the greatest songs of all time. \n\nGandalf was their manager at the time, and after meeting with the Eagles after Orthanc, he gave them the idea for the song. Hotel California is actually about Saruman imprisoning Gandalf. (\"You can check out anytime...but you can never leave\")\n\nRescuing Frodo and Sam was only a PR stunt orchestrated by Gandalf before the release of their album to gain publicity. In fact, some experts believe Hotel California would not have been as popular if the Eagles had not saved the ring bearer.\n\nSources: History of Rock and Roll class",

Before then, Glen and Randy and I would play with a few bards in Bree in pickup groups, and Joe Walsh was planning on doing a tour by himself in Harad, some USO thing for dismembered Orcs. Then this homeless guy who used to hang out by Linda Rondstadt's dressing room shows up and tells us that he'd pay us to go pick up two of his doofus friends who got stranded on top of a volcano. I didn't want to do it, but Glen said he could vouch for him... said his old college buddy Tom used to drop acid with him all the time and he was a pretty good guy. So, we did the gig and turned the two kids over to John and Robert and Jimmy and John, some weird folksingers over in Carouselambra or thereabouts, and, well, we got to talking, and one thing led to another. And so it goes.\n\nSource:  *Fly Like an Eagle, You Fools* 2nd Edition. 4th Age\n\nEDIT:  Some NZ film geek recommended I add a bunch of CGI to my post but I took it out. What a Feeble.",

Whether or not this is true, or merely a pleasing yet apocryphal urban legend, is a subject much debated by musical scholars. I believe Marty DiBergi was considering doing a documentary (or 'rockumentary', if you will) about it at one point.",

            "body": "I'm going to propose an alternate theory: the Eagles merely transcribed the existing Hotel California Song from their memories of the Song of Iluvatar, specifically the Second Theme.\n\nAs is told in the Ainulindalë, the Song that the Ainur created held all that was, is, and will be in Arda. In addition, as Rúmil of Tirion has noted, the Ainur went into Arda as the Valar and Maiar. Manwë was the greatest of the Valar, and to him were the Eagles dear. It is no great leap to assume that the Eagles heard much of the Song during their time with Manwë.\n\nGwaihir was the vassal of Thorondor, eldest of Eagles, and with his brother Landroval, an important figure in the history of the First Age. That he heard snippets of the Song from Manwë is surely incontestable, even in this darkened age.\n\nSo, when the Eagles went to Mordor to retrieve Frodo and Sam, they were already humming the music of \"Hotel California\". It merely took Don Henley to write down the lyrics and melody at a later date.",

In the cover for *Hotel California*, it is revealed that the album took 6 months to record; therefore, even had the Eagles not began recording before Frodo even left Bag End, they would have been within the time parameters.",

Don Henley lost his arm, the doctors were unable to reattach it... he can no longer play the drums.\n\nTheir dealer, nicknamed \"Frodo\" was left with a key of coke that he wasn't able to move, and ended up in custody. Thus never escaping \"Mount Doom\" (the Los Angeles FBI building). Tolkien changed the ending in his fictionalized account of the whole ordeal.\n\nHotel California is, of course, one of the most popular singles Steely Dan ever recorded. But don't feel bad, many young people get confused about which band sings which song nowdays ever since Spotify's patent lawsuit forced radio stations to stop identifying songs on the air.",
