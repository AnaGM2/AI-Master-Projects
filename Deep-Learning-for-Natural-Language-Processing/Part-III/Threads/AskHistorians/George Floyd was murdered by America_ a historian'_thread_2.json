    "description": "*From the /r/AskHistorians mod team*:\n\nMultiple histories of US police violence against the Black community are being written this week. They’ve taken the form of tweet threads, news articles, blog posts, and conversations among friends, loved ones, and even strangers on the internet. Amidst these waves of information, we as historians want our readers to remember the following: \n\nPolice brutality against Black people is woven into the fabric of the history of policing in the US—and reflects the historical reality that white America benefits from police and state violence against the Black community. George Floyd’s murder and the brutal suppression of the ensuing protests are the latest in a long history of police brutality and excessive, extraordinary violence. \n\nAs historians like Edward Ayers and Sam Mitrani have established, the construct of American policing was formed between roughly 1840-1880 on the crest of two trends. First, rising population density in cities brought middle-class and wealthy white Americans into close contact with people they considered disruptive to their orderly world: sex workers, impoverished drunk people, Black residents, immigrants. Second, a spiralling urban trend towards wage labor for larger corporations that was itself a disruption in some of the institutions that had previously guarded local order, like families and close-knit neighborhoods.\n\nFrom their establishment in the mid- to late-19th century, American police forces have depended on their mandate to keep or restore the white, wealthy ideal of order and the active support or tacit acceptance of this ongoing role by the majority of white Americans.\n\nThe history of lynching demonstrates this point with sickening clarity and is one we all should know. To highlight just one incident from the thousands that occured: a mob of white people dragged prosperous Black farmer Anthony Crawford from the Abbeville, South Carolina jail in full sight of the jailer and local sheriff on October 21, 1916. Crawford had been beaten and stabbed earlier that day; he was beaten again, possibly to death, hanged, and shot multiple times. His heinous crime? He accused a white man of trying to cheat him financially, and defended himself when a group of white men attacked him in response.\n\nJohn Hammond Moore has offered that one motivation for the lynching was a rumor the sheriff was going to help Crawford escape and the white murderers believed the police presence was not doing its job of keeping order according to their definition of “order.” However, when the sheriff and jailer looked the other way, they delegated their role of keeping order to the mob, empowering them to act on their behalf.\n\nIn Crawford’s case, it is easy to connect the dots between white people affording police the responsibility to keep order, white people benefiting from white supremacy, and state participation in unjust violence, not least because of the direct involvement of white civilians. We can easily see Crawford’s lynching as part of an broader phenomenon, not just an individual, extraordinary event. In effect, the police did - and kept doing - what white people wanted. A decade later, the Illinois Crime Survey highlighted:\n\n* The wildly disproportionate rate at which Black suspects were killed by Chicago police officers in comparison to the percentage of Black residents in the city\n* That a suspect or criminal (of any race) is “a product of his surroundings in the slum areas in the same way in which the good citizen is a product of the lake front environment.” [[PDF](https://homicide.northwestern.edu/docs_fk/homicide/ICS/ICS.28.pdf)]\n\nBy the 1920s, research pioneered by women scholars at the University of Chicago was already highlighting how stereotypes around “slum environment” turned residents into perceived criminals. They observed that the Black neighborhoods defined as \"slums\" exhibited precisely the same \"disorderly\" characteristics that had spurred the creation of official police departments in the previous century. And they observed how these conditions were the result of pervasive, systemic white supremacy. \n\nAdditionally, social workers documented how school segregation and the massive underfunding of Black schools by city politicians contributed to those same conditions, creating a feedback loop; The disorder the police were approved to combat was created by the lack of funding and resources. The ideal of order that the majority of white Chicagoans found attractive, in other words, both justified and resulted from police violence against their Black neighbors.\n\nThe nature of a survey, like the Illinois Crime Survey, demonstrates the same thing we recognize in lynching: individual cases of state violence against Black Americans, whatever the specific circumstances, are part of a pattern. But while the specter of lynching haunts the fringes of American crime, the pattern of police brutality against the Black community has not let up. In 2015, Jamil Smith showed how the final moments of some many of those killed by police across the decades echoed each other, again and again. \n\nFrom the Fugitive Slave Act to George Floyd, examples of police violence against Black Americans are endless, gruesome, and there for everyone to see and behold. In 1942, Private Thomas Foster was beaten and shot four times by Little Rock police officers after intervening to stop the assault of a fellow soldier. In 1967, a cab driver named John William Smith was savagely beaten by the Newark police. In 1984, New York City police officers shot Eleanor Bumpurs multiple times as they tried to evict her, making the call that getting her out of her apartment was more important than accommodating her mental health struggles. We could list hundreds, if not thousands, further such examples that illustrate this pattern.\n\nBut it’s not enough to say, “here are a bunch of examples of police officers brutalizing Black people.” The ability of individual officers to assault and kill Black Americans year after year, decade after decade, murder after murder, stems from the unwillingness of the white majority to step beyond protesting individual cases or do to more than stroke our chins and say, “Yes, I see a pattern.”\n\nThat pattern exists because despite every act of police brutality, and even despite protests following individual acts, white America’s preference for an \"orderly\" society has been a higher priority. From the inception of official police forces in the mid-19th century, to school truancy officers and border patrol, the American police have existed at the will of the white majority to keep and restore order, as defined by the white majority, using the \"necessary\" force, as defined by the mostly white police force and legal system.\n\nWhen we come to write the history of the last few days, we need to remember this wider context and that it goes beyond any single member of the police.  It is not that every officer is evil, but they do operate in a system which was designed to build and maintain white supremacy. Justice for the individual Black Americans killed by individual members of the police is necessary, but so is a long, hard look at - and action against - our understanding of societal order and how it must be upheld. \n\nExposing these structures has taken years of untold work and sacrifice on the part of Black communities, activists and historians. It is far past time that white Americans help rather than hinder this work.\n\n~~\n\n*Further Reading:*\n\n* Ayers, Edward L. *Vengeance and Justice: Crime and Punishment in the 19th Century American South*.

However, looking over the [Wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_of_Anthony_Crawford), the story it seems to tell describes the opposite of indifference by the local police. It claims that the sheriff arrested Crawford “most likely for his own protection” and that the mob “captured and disarmed Sheriff Burts” to be able to abduct him from the prison. Would you say that article is a mischaracterization or is exaggerating to make the authorities look better? Because the story that’s being told in the entry doesn’t really support the case in the post that police were a tool to enable white supremacy in this situation (not that there aren’t myriad other examples to support that fact). Obviously, Wikipedia can be flawed and I can’t comment well on the legitimacy of its sources, so I’d appreciate a historian perspective.",

Watching these events unfold, but mostly thousands of miles away, in a country whose history we “inherited” through our own experience of systemic racist violence and illegal annexation, it is easy to have empathy with black protestors and the overall cause of eradicating the scourge of racism from American society. I stand completely with the work of this movement and don’t want to decenter their struggles in any way. \n\nHowever, I can’t help but feel distant and remote from the way American history on this topic is often told, as my community and history weren’t even a part of that experience (other than very indirectly), and have a hard time understanding and contextualizing current situations in light of some obvious differences (for example the ruling class/majority in Hawaiʻi is not exclusively or even predominantly white, and black people are a tiny tiny minority who mostly do not have the same roots and history as black people on the US continent). \n\nAnd of course it is obvious that anti blackness, colorism, and racism have deeply permeated the experience of native Hawaiians and other communities of color in Hawaiʻi including, of course, the overincarceration of native Hawaiians and the disproportionate poverty among islander communities from Hawaiʻi, Polynesia, and Micronesia today. So I can empathize as a Hawaiian, but I don’t know how to necessarily reconcile that with the understanding that antiblack racism is unique and pervasive on a completely different level than racism again native Hawaiians and other indigenous folks. \n\nSo, long story short, does anyone have recommendations of resources to learn more about antiblackness, racist police brutality, and the history of colonization specific to Hawaiʻi and the US-colonized pacific (e.g., Guam, American Samoa, the Philippines), I would be very very interested in learning more. It can be hard to sort through resources focused on the continental US to see what applies more specifically to Hawaiʻi, as we often get left out of conversations about the country’s history.",

Though of course capturing even 100 years of history in a ~1000 word post is herculean, there were many detailed and nuanced points worth consideration. \n\nSpecifically, the structural relationship between geography and power. Chicago has a storied history of redlining, but even in places where the practice was not formally codified immense geographic stratification still occured; e.g., in Boston, my city, the city is divided from northwest to southeast by the Orange Line subway line. The great majority of black people live south of that line - with only one small exception, any black majority neighborhood is south of it. Literally, wrong side of the tracks. This was original research a few years ago, but you can also heat map the incidence of certain outcomes (incidence of fresh food stores; asbestos and lead related morbidities; etc) against that distribution and the results are alarming if not unexpected.\n\nI feel wholly convinced that even if the Floyd protests are wildly successful beyond our hopes in combatting police brutality, that this only scratches the surface of the systemic disenfranchisement of black and brown populations.\n\nI would find it very interesting to hear a historian's take on the self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, black students have lower educational attainment in part because the teachers *predict* they will be rowdy / uncurious / whatever, and give them less attention; then the racist points at PSAT scores or whatever and says, \"see? They *are* less capable.\" The abuse and misinterpretation of statistical data to make causal relationships btwn melanin content and outcomes are despicable but frequent across a range of fields and especially with respect to the intrinsically heinous debate over IQ scores but also in crime statistics. \n\nSo I don't know if it is really a good idea to entertain these arguments - if it would enable a form of \"JAQing off\" for example - but invariably we will all be exposed to this poor logic that bears the standard of \"scientific inquiry\" when making its equally poor conclusions. And I would find it very valuable, interesting, and relevant to explore the structural preconditions that systemically guaranteed certain outcomes (poverty, education, health, so forth). This kind of holistic inquiry elucidates the inherent multivariate nature of causal relationships and requires an argument that transcends individual policy or individual outcome. \n\nMoreover, the legacy of tests being weaponized as tools to disenfranchise black people has a gross and lengthy history, worthy of its own post.\n\nSorry to ramble. I just find that this community is both the most articulate and well-informed, but one of the most respected across reddit. I admire the stance the moderation team has taken and hope that they continue to shed light on this truly terrible history, so that we may learn from it and, of equal import, utilize those lessons in combatting the current situation.",
