    "description": "Hi, folks:\n\nYou might have missed it in the flood of political news lately, but [President Trump's budget proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/arts/nea-neh-endowments-trump.html?_r=0) proposes to defund the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (which helps fund PBS and NPR stations).\n\nYou may recall that we [ran a previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/) on this topic when the proposal was just a rumor, but now that it's an official proposal we decided to update this and ask you to take action. \n\nThe mission of /r/Askhistorians is to provide high-quality historical answers to a wide audience. We usually work online, through [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/askhistorians), [our Tumblr account](http://askhistorians.tumblr.com/), and here, but that's not all we do. [We talk to historians and bring them here for AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/amas). We have (with your help) [presented at historical conferences](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/february-2016/have-a-question-about-the-past-askhistorians). We also advocate: for good history, for civil discussion, and for keeping historical research going.\n\nThat's what we're doing today, and we need your help. \n\nWe don't get political for a particular candidate, a particular party, or a particular point of view. We get political when good history matters. **If you're American, we're asking you to call your Congressmen and Congresswomen to support funding for the NEA and NEH.**\n\nThe federal budget process isn't fast, and it isn't straightforward, but it *is* changeable. Each February, when the president submits his or her budget to Congress, there's a better chance of a cow getting through a slaughterhouse untouched than that budget staying in the same form. That's why your calls matter: Congress catches a lot of flak, but it does do work, particularly in the details of the budget.\n\nAnd we say *call*, not email, because calls matter. It's easy to ignore an email; you probably do it a few times on any given day. It's a lot harder to ignore a phone call. [Call your Senators and Congresswoman](https://www.govtrack.us/). You won't talk to them directly; you'll talk to a staffer or an intern answering phones. They've been getting a lot of calls lately. Chances are, they'll have a local office as well as their DC office. If you can't get through to one, try the other.\n\nDon't call other Congressmen than your own. It's a waste of time. Don't follow a script; those tend to get ignored. Just say who you are, where you're calling from (city/zip code, if you don't want to give your address), and what you're calling about.\n\nRepetition helps. Put the numbers in your cellphone and give 'em a call when you're headed to work or have a spare minute or two. It doesn't take a lot of time, but it can make a world of good.\n\nWhy are you calling?\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities funds a lot of good things. If you've seen Ken Burns' documentary *The Civil War,* you've seen some of its work. If you've read *Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-45*, you've seen some of its work. If you've visited your local museum, chances are that it too received some NEH funding.\n\nThere's something else important: **NEH funding indirectly supports what you're reading right now.**\n\nMany of our moderators, flaired commentators and even ordinary users have jobs that are funded in part or wholly by NEH grants. They have the spare time to offer their knowledge and skills here because of those grants. A lot of the links we provide in our answers exist because of the NEH. [The *Discovering America* digital newspaper archive is supported by the NEH.](https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/)\n\nThe NEH does all of that with just $143 million per year in federal funding. That's just 0.003 percent of the federal budget. If you make $40,000 a year and spent that much of your income, you'd be spending $1.20.\n\nFor all the NEH does, that's a good deal. \n\n------- \n\nThe previous post had three comments in reply that I'd like to highlight here: \n\n* u/restricteddata on the [history of the NEH](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd52t3d/)\n\n* u/khosikulu on the [types of grants](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd5xiok/) offered by the NEH\n\n* u/the_alaskan on how the NEH [benefits many people who aren't historians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd3sffh/)\n\n------- \n\nEdited to add this, from u/caffarelli: \n\n> If you're making a call for NEA/NEH, please also take a moment to mention [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/news-events/news-releases/institute-museum-and-library-services-issues-statement-presidents-proposed) which is also on the block, and to be crude, odds are better you'll personally be impacted by it's loss more quickly than any of the other federal humanities funding. IMLS funding is of particular importance to rural libraries and Native American museums and libraries, and can sometimes be the bulk of funding at those libraries. But if you're a patron of smaller public library, your library probably only got the Internet because of an IMLS grant, because that was their largest grant impact during the 90s-00s. It's a quiet, effective and responsible distributor of tiny amounts of federal money, that have nevertheless had an out-sized impact on the quality of public library services available in America.

All grants are searchable on their [wbesite here](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx), but I did some searches to find a few examples, with a focus on smaller, rural areas:\n\n[The L.C. Bates Museum](http://www.gwh.org/lcbates/LCBatesMuseum.aspx) in [Fairfield, ME, population 6,735](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield,_Maine)\n\n>The museum includes amazing natural history exhibits, fun local history, Native American collections, rocks and minerals, fossils, outside nature trails, picnic tables, and an arboretum behind the museum.  The museum even has themed art exhibits from artists of New England each summer through fall. \n\n[They recieved a $5,990 grant to help with their preservation goals](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=PG-251598-17):\n\n>The project is designed to turn an unused room on the museum's second floor into appropriate storage space for humanities objects, purchase shelving and storage supplies, train staff in storage methods, store the project collections, and present a public workshop on Storage Management in a Small Museum.\n\n----------------\n\n[Appalshop, Inc.](https://www.appalshop.org/) in [Whitesburg, Kentucky, population 2,139](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitesburg,_Kentucky):\n\n>Since 1969, Appalshop has been enacting cultural organizing and place-based media, arts and education to document the life, celebrate the culture, and voice the concerns of people living in Appalachia and rural America.\n\nThey got a [$12,000 grant](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=PY-253110-17) for a cultural history project titled \"The Hills Remember: Preserving Heritage in an Appalachian Coal Community\":\n\n>Building on a sense of place that is deeper than its Appalachian coal seams while confronting the limits of a fossil fuel based economy, Letcher County, Kentucky, is in a moment of transition. The proposed project will build upon local efforts to increase sense of agency and appreciation for the community's heritage and assets. It will result in the digitization of vernacular photographic materials, artwork and  3-Dimensional objects, historical paper records and audiovisual materials provided by members of the public and gathered as a result of community engagement, public programming, and digitization events. By catalyzing the area's cultural assets, the project will increase local capacity through activities that safeguard and celebrate both the archival materials collected and the wellspring of community expression and traditions.\n\n-------------\n\nThe [Town of Rockingham, Vermont, population 5,282](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockingham,_Vermont) recieved a $[6,000 grant](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=PG-52475-15) for the [Public Library](http://www.rockinghamlibrary.org/)'s \"Cataloged Photograph Collection Glass Plate Negative Rehousing Project\":\n\n>The Rockingham Free Public Library seeks to rehouse and properly store components of its extensive and popular Cataloged Photograph Collection. This collection contains photographic material from the 1860s-1970s and has provided visual information to support historic research on a broad range of topics of both local and national significance. Funds from The National Endowment for the Humanities Preservation Assistant Grant will support the rehousing training and purchase of archivally sound housing materials for the collection’s glass plate negatives and the purchase of a flat file to house larger format photographic prints. The furniture and rehousing activities would support the goal of a stable storage environment for the Library’s most popular local history collection.\n\n---------\n\nThe [Yellowstone Gateway Museum of Park County](http://yellowstonegatewaymuseum.org/), in [Livingston, Montana, population 7,044](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston,_Montana):\n\n>The Yellowstone Gateway Museum of Park County’s mission is to collect, preserve, and interpret the cultural and natural history of Park County, Montana and its relationship to Yellowstone Park for the education of everyone.  \n\nThey got [$5,102](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=PG-52585-15) for \"Archival/Photo Collection Preservation Project\":\n\n>The Yellowstone Gateway Museum of Park County (YGM) holds numerous significant manuscript, archival and photograph collections. Collections are held to preserve Park County and Montana’s heritage. YGM honors the spirit of Montana’s history by accessioning, processing, and making accessible archival materials that reflect the state’s diverse cultural background. Currently a large majority of these collections are located in a storage building behind the museum. The building does not have any environmental controls such as heating or cooling. Historic documents and photographs received by donors are currently stored in acidic boxes. As with many small museums, a large amount of backlog exists from the early years of development. Our goal is to move the material to the HVAC-controlled museum and store significant photographs and documents in archival folders, boxes, and cabinets to ensure the stability of the items for current and future researchers.\n\n-------------\n\nHopefully this helps to illustrate the kind of work that these grants can do. They are often very small, and they go to help small organizations which likely couldn't do the work that they aim to, or at least not on the same scale, without the help. All the grants are searchable [online](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx). I would certainly love to see people search through and share ones that have affected them!",

During 2010, their revenue was around $570M, so assuming 2010 and 2011 are directly comparable, CPB was paying for about 12% of PBS's budget.  \n\nAnother big chunk of PBS's revenues would of course be fees from all the local stations so they can run PBS content.  \n\nW/r/t NPR: NRP gets a very small portion of its annual revenue from CPB and it's not direct funding but grants, [per this page.](http://www.npr.org/about-npr/178660742/public-radio-finances)\n\n> On average, less than 1% of NPR's annual operating budget comes in the form of grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments.\n\nLike PBS, NPR gets fees from public radio stations who run their content, and that's a majority of their funding, so any cuts to the stations themselves (which are largely locally funded) would have secondary effect on the NPR organization itself, likely one large than the 1% in grants from CPB.",

            "body": "Oh boy an advocacy campaign. I know about these, I've helped run them and been on the receiving end of them.\n\n**Here are some tips:**\n\n**Be polite:** the offices of elected officials get a ton of communication, much of it nasty, hateful and mean. The fastest way to get ignored by an elected official is to be one of the folks being rude to their staff. They'll just write you off as someone to be ignored.\n\n**Be clear about what you want:** Senators/Representatives get a lot of constituent (and advocate) contact on a lot of issues. It is easy for the details of who wants what to be confused. To that end one of the first things you should say, should be something along the lines of: “I'm calling to ask the Senator/Representative to support funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.” \n\nSay it slowly and clearly so the person you are speaking with has time to write it all down. I'd recommend you say it again at the end of the phone call.\n\n**Be clear about why you want it:** The best argument for a program, is to tell them why it matters to you. The more personal the better. Maybe the NEA sponsored a great art instillation in your city, maybe the National Endowment for Humanities put on a great program you went to. The point is to humanize these programs, these offices hear about an alphabet soup of programs and are drowning in data, the more you can make a program's value clear in immediate human terms, the better.\n\n**Ask for a response:** Most of the time the person you talk to will be an intern or a staff assistant, they won't be able to give you a clear answer on the office's policy. Asking for a follow up ensures that your message will move up the food chain or at least force the office to actually have to deal with your ask.\n\n**More advanced tip:** Look to see if your representative/senator serves on the Appropriations Committee in either chamber. The Appropriations Committee is the one that makes the decisions about funding. If your representative/senator serves on the committee, it is even more important to contact their offices. If they aren't ask them to contact their fellow representatives/senators who are.\n\nThe House Appropriations roster: http://appropriations.house.gov/about/members/\n\nThe Senate Appropriations roster: https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/about/members\n\n**Also more advanced tip:** the most effective way to get a message to an elected official is by personally asking them. Most representatives/senators hold either electronic or physical town halls. Attending one of these and asking your representative/senator personally, is the best way to get them to support your programs. \n\n**FAQ on the appropriations process for FY 2017 and 2018:**\n\n**Question:** Just what is the President's Budget and why does it matter?\n\n**Answer:** The president is required by law to submit a budget of his recommendations for the federal budget to Congress. Congress is not required to act on them, and often goes to great lengths to tell everyone how little they care about what the president thinks. However, like Gertrude in Hamlet they protest too much.\n\nWhile dramatic programmatic changes and topline numbers in the president's budget often don't make it past the committee room, the president's budget also contains a ton of recommendations on what departments and agencies would like for their budgets. Those recommendations often do end up mattering. \n\nIt's worth noting that there is also a political element to this. The current President is a Republican, so Congress may end up spending more time considering what he has to say than they did the previous president. \n\n**Q:** Wait, above there you listed both FY 2017 and 2018 up there. What gives?\n\n**A:** Usually Congress handles only one year's worth of appropriations at a time. However, the Fiscal Year 2017 appropriation was never finished, so although we are like a third of the way through  FY 2017 (FY's run from October 1st to September 30th), Congress still needs to finish the FY 2017 appropriations.\n\n**Q:** Yeah, about. Just how the hell does this all work?\n\n**A:** I am so very sorry you asked. Basically annually Congress passes (or attempts to pass) 12 appropriations bills. Each funding a different set of agencies in the government. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees each have 12 subcommittees, each of which is responsible for one of the 12 bills. These bills are supposed to be passed annually before the fiscal year ends. \n\n**Q:** So where do these programs fit in?\n\n**A:** the funding for NEA/NEH is controlled by the House and Senate Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittees funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are controlled by the House and Senate Subcommittees on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. If you are fortunate to have a member on either subcommittee, it is vital that you reach out to them to ask that they support these programs. You can find out who is on the relevant appropriations subcommittees on the House and Senate Appropriations Committee websites.\n\nSenate: https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/\n\nHouse: http://appropriations.house.gov/\n\n**Q:** Do you have a source for the stuff you just said?\n\n**A:** Of course, this is still /r/askhistorians\n\nCheck out the CRS report on this here: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-721.pdf\n",

I think one of the problems people have (when giving only a quick glance to such programs) is that there are no tangible end-items. I realize this isn't the case much of the time, but if I were auditing a beneficiary what would I be looking for? Am I racking their progress up against their stated goals?\n\nAnd in that same vein, how are organizations chosen to receive funding? Are there boxes that need to be checked, like public benefit,  something along those lines? Who is the \"decider?\"\n\nTo be clear, I absolutely am not in favor of cutting these programs. The amount of money is trivial in the grand scheme of things and the cultural importance is invaluable. However, I don't think questioning government use of taxpayer funds should be anathema in any instance, ever. The amount of downvotes a handful of comments in this thread received seem to indicate some people would rather not have that type of conversation and I think that's a shame. Especially when you look at the stellar responses to many of those questions and realize what an opportunity it is to educate.",
