    "description": "I’ve always wondered why so many of the lessons about history (especially US history) taught during the early years of my education (late ‘90s and early ‘00s) were based on myths or tall tales that all my later teachers would have to completely negate. Stuff along the lines of “Columbus proved the Earth was round” or “Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity” or portraying the Founding Fathers as saintly heroes with no room for complexity/flaws.\n\nI’m not suggesting that 5-10 year olds should be exposed to the ugliest/most disturbing parts of our history for the sake of total accuracy, or that such young minds should be expected to grasp all the complexities of real history. But why are so many of these demonstrably false stories taught to young students as fact?\n\nEDIT: Some of the early replies have called into question whether I am misremembering that these stories were really TAUGHT as fact rather than merely told as stories. I won’t reject that possibility with regard to some of the specific examples I provided, but I certainly have many memories of history teachers (from around 6th grade on) having to dispel similar generalizations and falsehoods when reintroducing familiar topics. If the dissemination of bad history like this isn’t due to early education, it would still be interesting to know why/how it became so widespread as to require dispelling at all.",

            "body": "Focusing on the time period of your question and experience (late 1990's and early 2000's) and building off the fact that other comments have discussed the regional/local implications of differing standards.\n\nAnother comment mentioned specifically Virginia as their experience, and Virginia's Department of Education DOES have their past standards all posted in PDFS nicely organized on their website allowing us to make some direct comparisons of standards.  \n\nFor reference [Here](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/index.shtml) is the main page for the Virginia SOL's.  On this page are the most recent, adopted in 2008, as well as links at the bottom to previous iterations from 2001 and 1995.\n\nReading through the different history standards for the various grade levels did show some changes in their treatment of \"legends\" and \"stories\" in teaching history.\n\n[The 1995 Kindergarten Standards](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/previous_years/1995/history_socialstudies/history95k-12.pdf) have as their first history standard:\n>  The student will understand that history relates to events and people of other times and places by\n>\n•  identifying examples of past events in legends and historical accounts, including Paul Revere’s ride and\nthe  stories  of  Johnny  Appleseed,  Booker  T.  Washington, and Betsy Ross;\n>\n•  identifying  examples  of  interesting  Americans\nthrough exposure to biographies of important people\nof the past, including George Washington, Harriet\nTubman, Abraham Lincoln, and Davy Crocket\n\nBy 2001 [The standards](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/complete/stds_history.pdf) was edited to read:\n> The student will recognize that history describes events and people of other times and places by \n>\na) identifying examples of past events in legends, stories, and historical accounts of \nPocahontas, George Washington, Betsy Ross, and Abraham Lincoln\n\nAnd [The current version](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/next_version/stds_all_history.pdf) has:\n> The student will recognize that history describes events and people of other times and places by \n>\na)   identifying examples of past events in legends, stories, and historical accounts of Powhatan, \nPocahontas, George Washington, Betsy Ross, and Abraham Lincoln; \n\nLooking at the three versions we can see a clear shift in the 2001 standard removing what are considered the \"popular myths\" portion.  It is important to note that the two updated versions do still use the phrase \"legends, stories, and historical accounts\", which leaves a large room for error in the students not fully understanding the difference in the three.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Education also publishes a series of lesson plans for each of the grade level standards.  \n\nIn [The lesson plans for the standards US History Up to 1865](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/scope_sequence/history_socialscience_scope_sequence/2008/scopeseq_histsoc_ushist_to1865.pdf) there is a lesson (page 87 of the pdf) that covers the contributions of Thomas Paine and Patrick Henry.\nThe [corresponding standard](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/next_version/stds_ushistory_to1865.pdf) is:\n> c)   describing key events and the roles of key individuals in the American Revolution, with emphasis on George Washington, Benjamin Franklin,Thomas Jefferson, and Patrick Henry; \n\nIn this lesson the students are given links to an excerpt of *Common Sense* and a transcript of Patrick Henry's \"Give Me Liberty\" speech.  They are then instructed:\n>3.Have students read the excerpts individually or aloud as a class.\nIf some of the language is difficult for students to understand, have them look up unfamiliar vocabulary. After they have completed the readings, help them identify the main ideas, and have them complete their guided reading outlines.\n>\n4.Have students use the information from the readings and from the textbook to write a persuasive editorial for the local newspaper explaining why colonists should support the battle for independence. Show students examples of present-day editorials from the local paper to help them understand the format and purpose of an editorial.\n\nAs a lesson on its own there is nothing overtly wrong with this; however, if we compare this to a similar lesson published by the [University of Texas](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/coretexts/_files/resources/1775%20Give%20Me%20Liberty%20discussion.pdf) we can see that UT included in their lesson the statement:\n>The speech you read was not recorded in contemporary sources, but was instead recounted from \nmemory and reported to William Wirt (who was writing Henry’s biography) many years later in 1816.  Does the fact that Henry may not have actually said the famous words attributed to him “Give me liberty...” change the significance of this speech?  How does historical evidence change the impression we get of those who were the heroes of the American Founding?  Is it possible for the speech to be important even if we are not certain that it is accurate?  Why or why not?\n\nThe UT lesson includes an exploration into the possibility that the speech is apocryphal while the Virginia one does not; leading to students exploring the same idea with different levels of understanding.\n\nIf you explore the lesson plans for the lower grade level's on the Virginia DOE page many of the kindergarten lessons that accompany the standard listed above call on the teacher to find a text to read to their students that covers the event or person being discussed. As another comment already pointed out; most of the people teaching at these grade levels will not have taken many higher level history courses and may choose texts that perpetuate the myths without the teacher themselves realizing the inaccuracies.  \n\nThis issue is added to by the fact that in 2010 the Washington Post [published an article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/29/AR2010122903028.html) covering historical inaccuracies in textbooks being used in Virginia classrooms.  The texts and publisher being discussed in that article were (and still are) on the [approved textbook list](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/textbooks/history_social_science/index.shtml) published by the DOE.  The state is currently going through a new revision of textbooks but still on that site you can see that the books being discussed had to be updated to a second edition and re-approved (their works being approved in 2011) while all the other texts for the Virginia History and History to 1865 section were not put through the same process and still have their approvals from 2009.\n\nSo as a TLDR;\n\n* Standards from when you went to school may have included such myths\n* The lessons your teachers used may have omitted the historical complexity and/or possibility of the story being inaccurate\n* The texts that your teachers used may have had incorrect information printed in them that your teacher was not educationally equipped to catch.\n\nAlso a big shout out to the Virginia Department of Education for putting all their standards in such an easy to navigate and locate website.  I tried Texas first to look at the transition from the TEAMS test to TAAS and then TAKS and STAAR but couldn't find anything like what the Virginia DOE has on the Texas DOE website.\n",

            "body": "Education in the US is a highly localized affair, and as a result making broad statements about what is happening in any area of classroom education is difficult. Still, we can look to the research on elementary education to help answer this question. The first issue is that elementary teachers spend on average 1 hour of instruction just dedicated to history (that is, not integrated with other subjects like English Language Arts). As a result, at best elementary students are treated to an incoherent vision of history; the lessons tend to be isolated to individual events taught without a broader context. \n\nComplicating this further is that most elementary teachers will have taken only one college-level history course, usually a survey of US history. They will not have learned about historiography or the historical method nor studied any one topic in great depth. Thus when they get to their own classrooms, they lack a vision for the purpose of teaching history and often report lacking the confidence to teach historical topics. As a result, what they teach comes out of what they remember learning from their own elementary educations (Darling-Hammond calls this the \"apprenticeship of observation\"). And what they likely remember learning are the myths of national histories (Washington and the cherry tree, Columbus discovered America, etc.). \n\nFinally, these trends have been accelerated since 2001. With the passing of NCLB, a greater emphasis was put on success in standardized exams. In the NCLB framework, meeting proficiency in math and English language arts was what counted as \"success.\"  And if it's not tested, it's not likely to be taught. I'll offer a personal example that exemplifies this trend: for four years I ran professional development around history education for elementary teachers in NY.  When NY decided to end the 5th grade Regents exam in history, principals immediately pulled their teachers from our program, a program they hitherto praised and were excited to send their teachers to.  We repurposed our program from \"Teaching NY and US History\" to \"Teaching Non-fiction Texts\" and our numbers went right back up. The Common Core is also a set of standards in math and English language arts, so these trends are likely to continue.\n\nIn summary: history in the elementary years is not prioritized by the educational bureaucracy, likely resulting in minimal history instruction (if at all). In addition, elementary teachers lack the requisite content knowledge and/or the confidence to spend a great deal of time on historical subjects. Thus when students get to the high school years they have likely learned a great deal of history at home, in movies, in video games, etc., much may not be reliably told.\n\nSources:\nBrophy, J.

If not, forgive me. \n\nTeachers in all states of the United States are required by law to teach certain standards (standards may vary). I'm based in the state of Texas and we are required to teach the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills in our classrooms. You can find a comprehensive list of those skills here: https://tea.texas.gov/index2.aspx?id=6148\n\nTo be more specific, you requested information regarding why students in elementary schools are taught that Columbus discovered the earth was round, Ben Franklin and electricity, etc. In short, they aren't. Here is the link to the TEKS for Grade Level 6: http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/chapter113/ch113b.html\n\nColumbus isn't a topic for 6th graders in Texas, but if you scroll down to section 4, topic B, you'll see that the only mention of Benjamin Franklin refers to his role in the American Revolution. \n\nWhile I will admit that these requirements are simply a framework, there is also a system for teachers called the TEKS Resource System, which serves to clarify the TEKS for all Texas teachers. Some teachers will supplement lessons with the textbook, while others will use their own research conducted through college to decide which specific details they will teach.\n\nIt is worth nothing that these skills are updated and corrected over time, although I would have to assume that there was never a TEK that said, \"Teach that Columbus discovered the world was round,\" since that fact has been well-known for decades prior to your own experience.
