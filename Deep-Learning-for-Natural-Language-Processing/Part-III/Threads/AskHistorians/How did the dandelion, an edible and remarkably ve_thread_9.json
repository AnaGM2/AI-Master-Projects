    "description": "I was reading in the memoir of a Great Depression survivor that she would stop and gather dandelions while out looking for work and bring them all home for a dandelion dinner in case her mother had been unable to find anything to eat. This piqued my interest, and I did some research on the dandelion. I was shocked out how versatile this plant was-- the leaves were edible, the roots could be roasted as a coffee substitute, the milky sap inside the stem was said to have medicinal properties, and the flower tops could even be bottled and made into wine! \n\nHow and why did the dandelion come to be known as nothing more than a pesky weed? It seems like this flower got the raw end of the deal.\n\n**EDIT:** Wow. First of all, let me say that I am deeply thankful for the insightful, in-depth responses provided by both /u/gothwalk and /u/WRCousCous. You both have gone above and beyond in addressing my query, and I did not expect such expert-level responses to my question about the humble dandelion.\n\nSecondly, I am blown away with how popular this post has become. I cannot believe that it is the most highly upvoted question of all time in /r/AskHistorians. I hope this has exposed many people to the lost arts of foraging plants for food and medicine. This is something I feel that everyone should know more about.

            "body": "So, dandelions. First, in terms of the Great Depression, they're one of the generally disregarded products of the Columbian Exchange - there are some varieties of dandelion or closely related plants native to North America, but the ones you'd generally recognise are Old World imports. It's not clear whether they were intentionally imported or not, but given their seeding habits, the chances are good that they were accidental. They grow *anywhere*, and can be incredibly destructive plants when they push up through paving or have their roots crack through walls.\n\nThey're regarded as a food or medicinal plant through recorded history, though never as a particularly desirable one. Abū Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyyā al-Rāzī, known in the west as Rhazes, wrote about them around 900CE, but only as a medicinal plant, and Avicenna (Ibn Sina) reputedly devoted an entire chapter to them in one work a century later. As far as I can tell, though, they're not included by Al-Warraq in his cookery book in Baghdad, roughly contemporaneous with Ibn Sina (at least, I can't find any reference to them under the names I know, and the translator of the edition I have, Nawal Nasrallah, hasn't included them in the index of ingredients). They were almost certainly included in the range of green plants used by European medieval peasants in pottages, although, again, they're not actually included in any of the lists provided by Peter Brears in *Cooking and Dining in Medieval England*.\n\nThe Victorians seem to have made more use of the dandelion. E. Lewis Sturtevant, writing in 1886, notes it grown for the Boston market in 1836, and he says the seed is for sale in \"various seed catalogues of 1885\" in no less than 6 varieties. The first mention of dandelion as a vegetable he could find in England was 1846 in the Gardeners' Chronicle, where it's described as \"a beautiful and delicate blanched salad\". He also says \"[t]he influence of rich soil and protected growth upon the dandelion is to give increased size and succulence to the plant, and to thicken the branching of the leaves\", which is in line with most cultivated versions of wild plants. There was considerable interest in the Victorian era in new and exotic vegetables, much as there is now, and if they could be got by cultivating wild plants, so much the better.\n\nHowever, dandelions, once grown, can be very hard to remove from a given location. The taproot - which is edible too - can go down a metre without much difficulty, and unless it's pulled out entirely, the plant will regrow from it. This is a feature if you're harvesting it, since it'll reappear within weeks, but if you're trying to clear it from a bed to make way for something else, it's a pain. This is probably one of the two reasons that it's not really grown for food anymore - the other being that it's not terribly good. Arugula, or rocket, is generally better tasting than the leaf. The flowers *can* be made into a hedgerow wine, but you generally need to add other things (lemons, for example) to get anything that tastes palatable. The root can be dried, roasted, and ground to make a drink that is claimed to be like coffee, presumably by people who have never had coffee - but actual coffee, or even chicory, is better. And so forth. By 1911, the Britannica says, somewhat delicately, \"[f]or the purposes formerly recognized taraxacum is now never used\". In addition, the difference between the cultivated and the wild dandelion isn't really enough to merit growing it deliberately.\n\nThey're not the only vegetable to disappear from modern use through inconvenience - there's one called skirrets, which resembles carrots and parsnips, but has a bunch of longer, thinner roots, which are obviously more difficult to peel and cook than their fatter cousins, so they've been left behind. Likewise, alexanders, a leafy green, is more bitter and requires more cooking than celery, its closest modern equivalent, so it's been abandoned as well. I haven't eaten skirrits (yet), but I can assure you that alexanders taste like freshly cut hedgerow smells.\n\nThey're not _completely_ absent from modern cuisine, although they always seem to come with caveats. Harold McGee notes that it's 'occasionally grown on a small scale'. They're used in a traditional English soft drink called Dandelion & Burdock, which is still made (a brand called Fentimans is the one I know). There is a claim in various articles that a local variety called 'koproradiko' or 'mari' is eaten in Crete as a salad ingredient, or boiled, but it occurs in so many places with exactly the same phrasing that I suspect it's copied from a single source, and I can't find anything to back it up. They're eaten in Greece in general, though, as one of many plants under the label 'horta', and are known there as 'radikia'. 'Horta vrasta', which seems to be literally 'boiled greens' is possibly the most authentically historical way to eat them. Blanched leaves (grown under cover) are sometimes seen in salads in vegetarian restaurants here in Ireland, too, and they're occasionally used in French cuisine.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\nE.

            "body": "Beyond the aesthetic issues, dandelions cause a number of actual financial problems for cultivation. They basically can grow abundantly in any type of field. They reduce crop yields, slow down the drying of hay and similar crops (due to high water content), act as host to a number of crop devastating pests such as the [boll weevil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boll_weevil), bacteria, and viruses. Over use of it medically can shut down the liver. The pollen is an allergen that can contaminate honey. Along with affecting the honey, dandelions attract bees away from fruiting plants in orchards that need their services (however while perception of this impact is high, the effect is minimal). For lawns and grass courses, they have a higher water requirement than the grasses but can out compete, survive, and even kill nearby grasses. \n\nThere are some positive things about the plant, such as medicinal value, soil enrichment, and animal feed; however there are better alternatives that have less negatives.\n\nNow regarding the actual history in change of perception, I can only speculate and I won't. \n",
