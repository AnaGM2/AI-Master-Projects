This, ironically, just means actual questions get less attention which we of course don't want!!)\n\n#We return to our regular content now, [so please don't miss out on this excellent AMA on religion in America with Dr. Lincoln Mullen!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gawcy0/im_lincoln_mullen_author_of_the_chance_of)\n\n#And of course, if you are looking for some interesting stuff to read, check out [this week's Sunday Digest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g8euzh/sunday_digest_interesting_overlooked_posts_april/) which has a weekly round-up of great answers!\n\n#Edit: I appreciate the gildings, but please consider donating the amount that that guilding would cost to your favorite charity instead. I'd suggest your local foodbank, or similar type of organization that is helping people having trouble making ends meet during the pandemic.",
