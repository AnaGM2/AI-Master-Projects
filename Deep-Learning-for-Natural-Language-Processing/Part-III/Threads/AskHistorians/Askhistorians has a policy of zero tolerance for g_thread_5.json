    "description": "The Ask Historians moderation team has made the commitment to be as transparent as possible with the community about our actions. That commitment is why we offer [Rules Roundtables](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/faq/meta#wiki_rules_discussion) on a regular basis, why we post explanations when removing answers when we can, and why we send dozens of modmails a week in response to questions from users looking for feedback or clarity. Behind the scenes, there is an incredible amount of conversation among the team about modding decisions and practices and we work hard to foster an environment that both adheres to the standards we have achieved in this community and is safe and welcoming to our users.\n\nOne of the ways we try to accomplish this is by having a few, carefully crafted and considered zero-tolerance policies. For example, we do not tolerate racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, or antisemitic slurs in question titles and offer users guidance on using them in context and ask for a rewrite if there’s doubt about usage. We do not tolerate users trying to doxx or harass members of the community. And we do not tolerate genocide denial. \n\nAt times, genocide denial is explicit; a user posts a question challenging widely accepted facts about the Holocaust or a comment that they don’t think what happened to Indigenous Americans following contact with Europeans was a genocide. In those cases, the question or comment is removed and the user is permanently banned. If someone posts a question that appears to reflect a genuine desire to learn more about genocide, we provide them a carefully written and researched answer by an expert in the topic. But at other times, it’s much less obvious than someone saying that a death toll was fabricated or that deaths had other causes. Some other aspects of what we consider genocide denial include:\n\n* Putting equal weight on people revolting and the state suppressing the population, as though the former justifies the latter as simple warfare\n* Suggesting that an event academically or generally considered genocide was “just” a series of massacres, etc.\n* Downplaying acts of cultural erasure considered part of a genocide when and if they failed to fully destroy the culture\n\nIssues like these can often be difficult for individuals to process as denial because they are often parts of a dominant cultural narrative in the state that committed the genocide. North American textbooks for children, for instance, may downplay forced resettlement as simply “moving away”. Narratives like these can be hard to unlearn, especially when living in that country or consuming its media.\n\nWhen a question or comment feels borderline, the mod who notices it will share it with the group and we’ll discuss what action to take. We’ve recently had to contend with an uptick in denialist content as well as with denialist talking points coming from surprising sources, including members of the community. We have taken the appropriate steps in those cases but feel the need to reaffirm our strong stance against denial, even the kind of soft denial that is frequently employed when it comes to lesser known instances of genocide, such as “it happened during the course of a war” or “because disease was involved no campaign of extermination took place.”\n\nWe once again want to reaffirm our stance of zero tolerance for the denial of historical atrocities and our commitment to be open about the decisions we, as a team of moderators, take. For more information on our policies, please see our previous Rules Roundtable discussions [here on the civility rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ijkk9/rules_roundtable_10_civility_and_debating_with/), [here on soapboxing and moralizing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4eb8kr/rules_roundtable_9_soapboxing_moralizing_loaded/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/h8aapg/rules_roundtable_xvi_asking_uncomfortable/) on asking uncomfortable questions.",

            "body": "Quite a few questions are being asked here, and it can be hard to find *your* question even if it has been asked several times. We aren't going to answer the same question a dozen times, so if you are asking something already answered, you likely will not *personally* get a response.\n\n#As such, **Please Consult This List** to see if your question has already been raised and responded to:\n\n* If your question is \"What about [Armenian genocide/Rwandan genocide/Bosnian genocide/etc.]?\" the answer is almost certainly going to be yes. Those mentioned in the OP are not exclusive, and this rule almost certainly covers whatever genocide you are thinking of. It also covers atrocities which aren't *always* labeled genocide, but are entirely agreed to have happened. Discussions about intentionality and scope *which occur within the academy* are generally allowed here, as they aren't based on denial of the underlying, agreed upon facts, which is what denialism focuses on. This is addressed at a few points, including [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxnk58e/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxndn6w/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxnrxxn/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxnodjo/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxnmb0g/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxni2yo/).\n* If your question is about something going on *recently* and whether it qualifies as genocide, or how we'd handle denial of it, ask again in ~20 years. For now, that is off the table due to our 20 Year Rule, so a moot point.\n* If you want to know more about Genocide studies, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxn3bhr/).\n* If you are concerned about users who are honestly confused but asking in good faith, this is addressed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxmys66/).\n* If you are concerned about free speech and the stifling of open debate, please see [this explanation of the reasoning](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxo7ey0/) or [also here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxmt7we/), and [here if you specifically think upvotes should decide](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hp5zw0/askhistorians_has_a_policy_of_zero_tolerance_for/fxng5ng/).\n\nIf you are asking a question that is essentially of those already answered, again, it likely will be removed and unanswered. We don't need 10 more people asking the same question which has already been answered several times. If you have *further* questions, please consider engaging with one of the answers already present in the thread.\n\nEdit: *Seriously*, people, read this post first and stop asking if the Armenian genocide is included in this policy... *Of course it is!*",

They accept there were massacres but they don't accept the term \"genocide\". \n\nWould you say that the historians in TTK are actually consider it that way, or they just can't officially accept the term genocide due political pressure?\n\n\nEdit: As a note to first example, I always found it funny how Armenian Genocide denialists use it constantly. The levels of hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance is unbelievable, they say Armenians deserved to die because there were Armenian separatists demanding independence and a national sovereignty of their own, then go on and glorify the concepts of independence and national sovereignty when it comes to the discussion of Turkish independence war.",
