    "description": "As those who’ve followed us *especially* closely may know, AskHistorians has had quite a varied social media presence over the years. The goal of engaging with other social media platforms beyond Reddit has always been twofold. First, to widen our audience and promote answers (and questions) as best we can. Second, to reach communities of historians and encourage them to engaging with our audience, whether as one-off podcast or AMA guests, or as more consistent providers of answers.\n\nMost other platforms haven’t worked out all that well for us – our content didn’t readily translate to places like Instagram, and our institutional aversion to AI-generated slop made Facebook a dead end a while back. We had high hopes for Tumblr, but our broad insistence that smutty fanfic about historical figures was ‘not actually *history*, per se’ and ‘actually in poor taste sometimes tbh’ ended up being a dealbreaker. However, until recently we did maintain a moderately active and successful Twitter presence, which had proven to be the most consistently useful alternative platform to connect with both historians and history-enjoyers.\n\nThis utility has now faded significantly. Aside from our considerable ethical concerns about the state of the platform and its ownership, it has become clear that the once-vibrant history twitter community has diminished considerably. Changes to the API (sound familiar?) also scuppered our ability to continue using the platform as we once had, and we were distinctly unmotivated to work to find alternative solutions. As such, aside from very occasional one-off posts, our Twitter account has grown mostly dormant.\n\nHowever, it has taken us a while to decide whether to try to replace this branch of our activity. For an all-volunteer team, we need to be quite pragmatic about whether new initiatives are sustainable and worth the investment in effort – that is, if a new platform isn’t giving us significant new reach in terms of either key demographics (ie historians) or wider audiences, then we can’t justify dedicating significant time and energy to using it. In other words, replacing our Twitter account was not an automatic decision, as simply deciding not having an account of this kind was potentially the best option.\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, our judgement is that when it comes specifically to our second goal – ie engaging with online communities of historians – Bluesky has reached the point where it is a viable alternative to Twitter for us. Bluesky does not (yet) have the mass audience of some other established social media platforms, but the concentrated migration *specifically of historians* has reached the point where it serves a clear purpose for us to engage there. \n\n**As such, this post has two main functions (well, three if you count sharing AskHistorians lore):**\n\n1. If you already use Bluesky, then please follow us at [askhistorians.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/askhistorians.bsky.social). If you regularly contribute here and would like to have your work acknowledged on Bluesky, then let us know your handle and we’ll follow you and tag you if your work is showcased. We have already started putting together a Starter Pack of regular AskHistorians users/flairs who have an account there, which you can find here: [https://bsky.app/starter-pack-short/AXQNBFg](https://bsky.app/starter-pack-short/AXQNBFg)\n2. If you use social media with the aim of connecting with historians for whatever reason, then at this point we recommend signing up for Bluesky. You no longer need to have a referral code in order to do so.",
