            "body": "It's well established now that Mr. Kennedy had a, if you will, *boatload* of health problems for which he was heavily medicated and used adaptive technology to counteract. Official health records and Mr. Kennedy's medical staff confirm this, in particular his debilitating back pain. Biographers have even described a power struggle among physicians treating the president over whether more exercise or continued painkiller injections was the better option for treatment. (Spoiler alert: physical therapy).\n\nLikewise, Arthur Schlesinger's (relatively) recently released interviews with Mrs. Kennedy affirm that on Inauguration Day, she took Dexadrine between the inauguration ceremony and the evening ball to get through it.\n\nSo the question is really whether Mr. Kennedy's medical-treatment drug useage extended to \"drugs to lift you up for the event and bring you down gently afterwards\", and whether Mrs. Kennedy repeated her use of an amphetamine.\n\nThe difficulty for historians is that the attention here focuses on a shady celebrity doctor named Max Jacobson, who based his treatment program, reputation, and not coincidentally income on a cocktail drug injection based around amphetamines and painkiller. The vast majority of the evidence for Mr. Kennedy's \"off track betting\" use of drugs comes from Jacobson's unpublished biography; he (of course) destroyed his medical records. (And not just drugs adminstered by Jacobson--he tells one anecdote of Mrs. Kennedy discovering Demerol in their bathroom and her asking *him* to convince her husband not to take it). Furthermore, Jacobson was never on the White House medical staff and does not appear among counts of official entourages for various state visits abroad.\n\nJournalist and professor Richard Reeves (*President Kennedy: Profile of Power*) seems to be one of the few writers on the Kennedys who has actually bothered to investigate the possible veracity of Jacobson's claim. Here is the evidence he gathered:\n\n* The FBI file for Jacobson asserts that Mr. Kennedy was listed as one of his patients by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs\n* Jacobson visited the White House 30+ times from 1961-1962 (in late '62-'63, Mr. Kennedy's official medical staff headed by George Burkley cracked down on his more freewheeling medical treatment preferences, so the timing fits)\n* For a presidential trip to Vienna, Dr. and Mrs. Jacobson are listed in White House documents as booked into a room in the entourage hotel\n* A memo from Mrs. Kennedy's social secretary notes Dr. Max Jacobson coming to visit *her*--although I'll note that could easily refer to a discussion about her husband's health rather than her own (see the Demerol story above, for example)\n\nThe Kennedy presidency was incredibly carefully stage-managed, above all by Mrs. Kennedy herself. (Who was also no slouch in the political arena, recent historiography has begun to reveal.) Sealed records, destroyed records, stigma against people with disabilities, and the eternal popularity of conspiracy theories about/involving/by/against the Kennedys complicate our ability to get a crystal clear picture. However, the evidence suggests that there was a relationship between Jacobson and the Kennedys, and it seems a fair presumption that between Jacobson and Mr. Kennedy at least it was a doctor-patient one.\n\nAs to domestic violence, I can only say that (20 year rule applied) the historiography on spousal abuse and U.S. presidents/first ladies is *extremely* sparse. Almost unbelievably so. Rumors circulated that Grover Cleveland's \"boorish\" behavior extended to battery of his wife Frances; she went on public record denying them and affirming that their marriage was basically perfect. Rachel (Mrs. Andrew) Jackson survived an abusive marriage before marrying the future president. I caution that this is referring to physical abuse rather than verbal or emotional. No, I don't think that's the whole story even with the limitations, but scholarship on first ladies is still young and largely hagiographical/biographical. I suspect this is a \"stay tuned\" topic for the future.",

            "body": "The first and most important step is to get as close to the primary sources (interviews, records, diaries, letters, etc.) as possible. Ideally, this means having a full-text copy of the original--it's very easy for a misinterpretation, typo, or error to make its way into one secondary source that then gets picked up by later scholars citing the *scholarship* instead of going back to the original. In this particular case, it wasn't possible for me to, y'know, access FBI files remotely on a Friday night. So I looked through my secondary source collection on first ladies/White House culture and some biographies of President Kennedy to see which ones had hard citations to particular places in sources--that is, to a *specific* microfiche slide in a *specific* collection; to a specific page number in a specific published or archival source. (A lot of people just say something like, \"According to Burkley, Kraus brought up the next idea\".)\n\nBut as you say, primary sources also aren't necessarily objective and/or reliable. So it's important to look at: (1) who is the author or speaker, what their motives are, whether they *could* be telling the truth; (2) what is the nature (genre) of the source--a press release is a very different type of document than internal records, with different purposes, standards, and even patterns of language use.\n\nIn this case, you're absolutely right--there are *plenty* of anecdotes from people who knew Mr. Kennedy before and during the presidency of his supplemental use of drugs that speak of first- or secondhand gossip. It can be from an old friend claiming to have introduced Mr. Kennedy and Dr. Jacobson; or from Ruth Jacobson retelling stories she claimed to have heard from her husband. These are trickier. Strength in numbers is one good way to verify--account after account after account, especially if they refer to a variety of incidents, can give credence to a possibility/rumor. Researching whether the individual source *could* be right is another strategy--like what I showed Reeves doing above. And most importantly, information is power. Learning as much as you can about the source can help build a fuller picture of them, their motivations, and their patterns of writing or behavior.\n\nI hope that helps a little!",
