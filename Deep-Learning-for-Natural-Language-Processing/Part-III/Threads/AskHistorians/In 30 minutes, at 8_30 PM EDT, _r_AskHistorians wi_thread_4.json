It was on an opt-in basis, allowing moderators to decide whether their communities would have them or not. We were told we would always have this control.\n\nToday, that promise was broken, and in the worst way possible. With no forewarning, and [one very hidden announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/gacdqy/new_start_chatting_feature_on_reddit/) *not* in the normal channels where such information is announced to mods, the Admins rolled out chat rooms on all subreddits, even those which have purposefully kept chatrooms disabled for various reasons, be it simply a lack of interest, viewing them as not fitting the community vision, or in other cases, covering subject matter they simply don't believe to be appropriate for chat rooms.\n\nBut these chat rooms are being done as an end-around of those promises, and entirely without oversight of the moderators whose communities they are being associated with. At the top of our subreddit is an invitation to \"*Find people in /r/AskHistorians who want to chat*\". This is false advertising though. The presentation by the Admins implies that the chat rooms are affiliated with our subreddit, which is in no way true.\n\nThey are not run according to our rules, whether those for a normal submission, or the more light-hearted META threads. We have no ability whatsoever to moderate them, and in fact, it is a de facto unmoderated space entirely, as the Admins have made clear that *they* will be moderating these chat rooms, which is troubling when it can sometimes take over a week to get a response on a report filed with them.\n\nAs Moderators, we are unpaid volunteers who work to build a community which reflects our values and vision. In the past, we have always been promised control over shaping that community by the site Admins, and despite missteps at points, it is a promise we have trusted. Clearly we were wrong to do so, as this has broken that trust in a far worse way than any previous undesired feature the Admins have thrust upon us, lacking *any* control or say in its existence, even as it seeks to leverage the unique community we have spent many years building up.\n\nWe unfortunately have very few tools available to us to protest, but we certainly refuse to abide quietly by this unwanted and unwelcome intrusion into the space we have worked to build. As such, we are using one of the few measures which is available to us, and will be turning the subreddit private for one hour at 8:30 PM EDT. \n\nThis is *not* a permanent decision by any means. It will be returned to visible for all users one hour from the start, 9:30 PM EDT, but this is one of the very few means available to us to stress to the Admins how seriously we take this, and how deeply troubled we are by what they are doing.\n\nWe deeply thank our community members for their understanding of the decision we have taken here, and for everything they have done to help shape this community as it has grown over the years.\n\nThe Mods",

Thank you all for the fantastic work that you do!\n\nI know it is jarring to some at first to see how differently this subreddit is moderated, but people either get used to it and love it... or they leave. Isn't that what Reddit is about, anyway? Sure, the posts on r/history can be interesting sometimes, so I subscribe to that, too. But I know that while r/history is a more \"open\" discussion for the general public, the content is not the same quality as r/askhistorians. They have different purposes... and that's great!\n\nI'm really happy to see how r/askhistorians have inspired other \"r/ask\" subreddits like r/askscience or r/askengineers. I don't think any of them are at the level or r/askhistorians yet, but they seem to be making progress towards that! It's excellent to see a space for high-quality content that is discussed with civility and depth.",

I saw the announcement, but I'm not a moderator of anything. just a dude who's had a reddit account for 11 years.\n\nAs far as I see *nobody* wants 'new reddit'. Nobody wishes reddit were more like facebook. Nobody is looking to \"Chat with other folks who are into your same niche subreddit interests\". \n\nThe thing I like about reddit, the thing that's kept me here this long, after Slashdot, and Digg, and all the other attempts at aggregators, is that reddit is straightforward. It does one simple thing and does it well.\n\nI don't need Reddit to be my Facebook. I have a Facebook for that. I don't need it to be image or video hosting platform. I have imgur and youtube for that. I don't need it to be my chat platform. I have Discord, and y'know, IRC and usenet have kind of been a thing for a while. I don't need reddit to be my \"influencer platform\" or my Uber or my Yelp or my place to mail order Siamese cats or whatever the hell it even is they're trying to be now, because god knows it seems like they're just throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. \n\nFFS reddit, just be reddit. It's literally the only thing you're good at, and there's nothing wrong with that.",
