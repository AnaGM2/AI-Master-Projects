    "description": "Given the unprecedented events today and my contributions about the history of American elections on the forum over the last year, I've been asked by the mods here at /r/AskHistorians to write a little bit about how today's events might be viewed in the context of American history.  This is an unusual thread for unusual times, and I would ask for the understanding of those who might be inclined to immediately respond as if it were a normal Reddit political thread.  It isn't.\n\nIt's a real doozy, though, ain't it; I don't think any of us would have ever expected to see our fellow citizens nowadays storming Congress, disrupting the electoral process and carrying off rostrums.  But it's happened, and what I'll say to start is something simple: on the Federal level, this is indeed unprecedented.  Oh, you can certainly talk about the Civil War as an entirely different level of sedition, and varying attempts to suppress the franchise have been a constant theme from the beginnings of the Republic.  But this is the first time that the United States has not negotiated the transfer of power peacefully during a Presidential transition, and it's worth reviewing how it dodged the bullets in the past.\n\nAfter the Election of 1800, Jefferson himself feared that the lame duck Federalist Congress would attempt to use the accidental deadlock in the Electoral College between him and Aaron Burr as justification to place one of their own as Acting President for the remainder of 1801 until the convening of the new Democratic Republican-controlled House in December.  There is evidence that he and others working on his behalf - namely the Democratic-Republican Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania - would have called out the militia to storm Washington to prevent this.  Fortunately, thanks to Federalist James Bayard of Delaware, this did not come to pass as Jefferson won the runoff, and the first peaceful transition of power in the United States resulted.\n\nIn 1876, the successful efforts by Republicans to shift 20 electoral votes from Democratic nominee Samuel Tilden to Republican nominee Rutherford Hayes during recounts in South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana produced threats of violence as well.  [George McClellan actively attempted to gain support in raising a militia to install Tilden, and in response to perceived threats of violence by him and others, then-President Grant reactivated Civil War forts surrounding Washington.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gppet5/after_the_us_elections_of_1876_i_understand_that/frp4dph/)  Fortunately, for reasons we are still unsure of, Tilden was lukewarm about the prospect, spent the first month writing legal briefs on the illegitimacy of the Hayes recount rather than politicking, and with numerous Southern Democrats already having reached a deal with Hayes' operatives to remove Federal troops from the South if he were to be elected, ultimately decided that he probably could not win even in the Democratic-controlled House and chose not to contest the election.  Again, a peaceful transition of power resulted.\n\nThis has not, however, been the case for large parts of American history on the state level.\n\nIn 1838, a gubernatorial election in Pennsylvania led to what has been called the \"Buckshot War.\"  A gubernatorial election had ousted the incumbent Whig/Anti-Masonist by a slim margin of 5000 votes, both Democrats and Whigs claimed voter fraud (which both likely committed), and because of the resulting fights over who had won the state House elections in the districts that were disputed never resolved, two separate bodies claiming be the lawful Pennsylvania House of Representatives - one controlled by Whigs, the other Democrats - were formed.  This produced an interesting scene at the State House when, \"...before they began their separate deliberations, both groups attempted to occupy the physical building in which the official Pennsylvania House of Representatives was to meet, with some pushing and shoving as their two different speakers simultaneously took to the podium.\"\n\nSince both the state House and Senate were required to vote to declare the lawful winner, and the Senate was controlled by their party, Whigs had a path to retaining their governor if they managed to hold on to the House.  This led to a declaration by the Whig Secretary of State of Pennsylvania, Thomas Burrowes, that even for the times was remarkable: not only would he disallow the Democratic returns that were in dispute, but that members of his party should behave \"as if we had not been defeated\" since \"an honest count would put (their candidate) ahead by 10,000 votes.\"  One historian has described this as \"a coup d'etat.\"\n\nThis was made worse by the incumbent governor calling out the state militia, ostensibly to keep the peace but in reality to attempt to shut Democrats out.  Fortunately, state militia commander General Robert Patterson told the Governor directly that he would protect lives and property but under no terms would intervene in the conflict, \"“If ordered to clear the Capitol and install in the chair either or both of the Speakers, (I) would not do it.” Likewise, “if ordered to fire upon those [the Whigs] chose to call rebels, (I) would not do it [either].”  (His orders for his troops to arm themselves with buckshot gave the dispute its name.)  Frustrated, the Governor sent the militia home, requested federal troops, and received the following response from President Van Buren: \"To interfere in [this] commotion,” which “grows out of a political contest,” would have “dangerous consequences to our republican institutions.\"\n\nUltimately, the conflict ended with three Whigs defecting and providing the Democratic side of the house a quorum to certify the election of the disputed Democrats and the Democratic governor, but the potential for bloodshed was very much real; in fact, while plotting with Burrowes for Whig control of both houses so he might gain election to the US Senate (this was in the days of legislatures electing Senators), Thaddeus Stevens was the subject of an assassination plot that resulted in both men escaping from a basement window in bare possession of their lives.\n\nI don't have time currently to detail it all, but this was a pattern that repeated elsewhere many times during the 19th century.  Bashford against Barstow in Wisconsin in 1856 nearly got another militia battle, Bleeding Kansas and the bloody Lecompton pro-slave legislature in 1857 onwards outright previewed the Civil War, and Kentucky in 1899 had the Democratic candidate for governor outright assassinated in the midst of counting ballots.  Add in local disputes and the list gets longer; democracy has had very rough edges at times.\n\nBut I would urge you to take heart.  Even in chaos, today's United States is still not 1872 Louisiana, where something like 100 African Americans were brutally murdered at Colfax following a dispute over a gubernatorial election.  Nor is it 1876 South Carolina, where perhaps 150 were killed in pre-election violence where both Democrats and Republicans attempted to rig the election by shooting at each other.\n\nMaybe it won't end up doing so at the Capitol, but Congress will convene, the election will be concluded, and the will of the people recognized.  We will learn and grow from it, move on, and create a more perfect union. \n\nHang in there, folks.\n\nEdit: A couple typos, and yes, as many have pointed Wilmington is one of those local events I was referring to that was equally as ugly as some of the ones I've mentioned on the state level.

            "body": "Argentina endured through six different coup d’etats in the span of the twentieth century. I’ve spoken about the last military dictatorship [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f5t8rn/how_was_state_terrorism_perpetrated_in_argentina/fi11pis/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), a brutal dictatorship that disappeared, tortured and murdered over thirty thousand people. As soon as the democratically elected president Estela Martínez de Perón was removed from office, the military junta eliminated the National Constitution and Congress, effectively erasing every single human right and constitutional guarantee in a single, swift action.\n\nToday however, I’d like to talk about the first coup of the century: the 1930 one. On the morning of September 6th, a group of military officers, opposition civil servants and businessmen led by general José Uriburi seized power, removing president Hipólito Yrigoyen from office four years before his term was due to be over. With Uriburu’s self-proclamation as provisional president, came a period of fraudulent presidencies that we’ve come to know as the Infamous Decade. \n\nUriburu’s government was marked by an attempt to construct a corporatist State framework that would attempt to mitigate the effects of the 1930 global economic crisis, by transferring all political power and policy-making authority to corporations favourable to the ruling oligarchical class, to which Uriburu answered. Their aim? To restore said ruling class to its former glory, to the final decades of the nineteenth century, when the oligarchy led the country by means of electoral fraud, voter suppression and intimidation, in a period known as the 80s Generation. Following the profoundly positivistic and social darwinistic ideological structure of the 80s Generation, the new oligarchy believed firmly in controlling the population through fear and repression, in order to restore what they understood to be the primary bedrock of “order and progress”: a profoundly strict and suffocating social hierarchy through which the popular masses would exist under a constant state of subalternity, ignorance and illiteracy, allowing the ruling elite, the proverbial chosen ones, only people righteous and rational enough to rule, to enrich themselves while commanding every aspect of the political and economical structure of the country. And so, Uriburu started rounding up militants and affiliated members of the Civic Radical Union, Yrigoyen’s party, and incarcerating them, attempting to change the Constitution in the process in order to eliminate the individual, secret and universal suffrage instituted by Law 8871 of 1912, also known as Law Sáenz Peña, and replace it with an electoral system controlled by corporations. However, his corporatist attempt failed, and the economic crisis worsened to the point where he was forced to resign in 1932, even after having suppressed and cancelled several provincial elections.\n\nEven if the corporatist project had failed miserably, the oligarchy hadn’t given up. All through Uriburu’s de facto presidency, they had prepared a new alliance of right wing parties (including a dissenting faction of Yrigoyen’s Radical Civic Union called the Anti-personalist Radical Civic Union), called La Concordancia, The Concordance. Through the following decade, the Concordance ruled the country through fraud and voter suppression, bankrupting Argentina in the process of enriching themselves. Arguably the most notable example of this was the Roca-Runcimann pact, signed during Agustín Justo’s de facto presidency. The treaty secured a minimum export quota of three hundred and ninety thousand tons of frozen meat to the United Kingdom, in exchange for 85% of said meat to be exclusively processed in British-owned frigorifics installed in different parts of Argentina, and also in exchange of Argentina committing to only buying the entirety of its coal requirements directly from Britain. As a result, Argentina developed a long lasting dependency relationship with the UK, which impacted heavily on the country’s ability to industrialize and advance technologically in one of its main productive sectors, husbandry.\n\nI could go on forever about the Infamous Decade, but I’d like to point out one more thing. During the de facto presidency of Robert Ortiz, who ruled from 1938 to 1940, a secret law was issued, Circular N°11, which stated that Argentine consuls ought to\n\n>negar la visa aún a título de turista o pasajero de tránsito a toda persona que fundadamente se considere que abandona o ha abandonado su país de origen como indeseable o expulsado, cualquiera sea el motivo de su expulsión.\n\nMeaning\n\n>deny visas, even if asked for under tourism or passenger in transit to any and all persons who can be considered to have abandoned their country of origin after having been branded as an undesirable or expelled, whichever the reason for said branding.\n\nGee, I seem to remember a certain country that in 1938 was very much into branding certain ethnicities as undesirables, many of whom tried their very best to escape and seek refuge in other, more tolerant countries. But alas, the Infamous Decade was as ideologically fascist as the Nazis. They just didn’t get the chance to enact a genocide on any people. Lucky me I guess, my native ancestors probably wouldn’t have been able to survive *two* genocides in one generation. My Jewish ancestors barely survived their genocides. Anyhow.\n\nInterestingly enough, the Infamous Decade was ended abruptly by yet another coup, which deposed de facto president Ramón Castillo and instituted a provisional military government led first by Pedro Ramírez (1943-1944) and then by Edelmiro Farrell (1944-1946). Farrell called for elections to be organized in 1945, the first free, democratic elections since Yrigoyen won in 1928. And along came president Juan Domingo Perón, who had been part of the military coup of 43, and had worked as Secretary of Labour and Social Security, Minister of War and Vice President under Farrell.\n\nPerón was overthrown in 1955, three years before his second presidential term was over. And so another dictatorship came along, which lasted until 1958. And then, democratically elect Frondizi was removed by yet another military coup, led by a civilian this time, José María Guido, in 1962. That one lasted a whole year! And then, barely three years later, yet another democratically elected president, Arturo Illia, was also removed by yet another coup. These officers called themselves the Argentine Revolution, and they created a Statute that was positioned alongside the Constitution in hierarchical legal terms, but in reality effectively replaced the Constitution for all intents and purposes. During this period, the three de facto presidents, Onganía, Levingston and Lanusse, did their very best to erase Perón’s Justicialist Party from the face of the country, persecuting, arresting, torturing and forcing into exile any and all sympathizers of the movement. And yet, this dictatorship was also over eventually. Their authoritarianism became too much for the country to stand. Amidst several armed insurrections by peronist armed organizations, the military was forced to call for elections, in which Héctor Cámpora, a long time ally of Perón, won the presidency. Cámpora then stepped down after his inauguration, calling for new elections in which Perón, newly returned from his exile in Spain, was elected president for a third time, with his third wife, Estela Martínez de Perón, as his Vice President.\n\nAnd we come full circle. Perón died soon after, in 1974, and his Vice President succeeded him. With a politically neophyte president, perceived as weak and lacking enough charisma to garner the level of support her husband had had, the military and the ruling oligarchy saw yet another opportunity to seize power. See the pattern yet? And so, on March 24th, 1976, Jorge Rafael Videla communicated to the country that the armed forces were now in control of the government. And they remained in control until popular unrest and economic debacle forced them to call for elections in 1983.\n\nSo here we are. I was born after democracy had already been restored, but my family lived through it, and survived. My grandfather was kidnapped, tortured and held prisoner by the military in 1977. He bore the marks of the torture by electrocution they inflicted on his body until his death a few weeks ago, and I tell his story with pride. My country lived through more turmoil in less than a century than others live in several generations. And we have survived all of it. We are still standing. \n\nAre there those who would deny the crimes of the dictatorships? Of course. As a historian I face them every day, even here, each and every time I speak about these issues I get attacked by those who would downplay, justify and deny the atrocities committed by de facto governments. But I will continue to share these historical events, because it is my duty to every one of you, and every one of mine. \n\nWhere there is power, there is resistance.",

Gild him!**\n\nFascism is by its nature, by its design a violent movement and so it is no stranger to both coups and other attempts to take political power and political space by violence. Indeed, violence and its public display is an essential ideological feature of fascism as a political ideology.\n\nUnlike the advocates of liberal democracy, it is not reason or modernization, which drives forward and unlike communists, it is not material relationships. For the Fascist the engine of history is conflict, whether between nations, peoples or races. History is a constant struggle in which a community of mythical qualities needs to assert itself in order to gain dominance over others. Dominance is the core goal and must be asserted. And only if the right and rightful people dominate will a golden age begin.\n\nThe political utopia of the Fascist differs greatly from liberal or communist visions of utopia: Both of the latter are built on a vision of a utopian future that needs to be built and achieved. The Fascist on the other hand looks to the past for its utopia since most fantasies of dominance are historically justified. Whether it is the return to the Roman Empire or the mythical Lebensraum of German kings, all Fascist utopian visions are built upon a return to a hazy, mythological past in which the world was right. And such a return must by necessity be a violent one, one that engages in the eternal conflict with the supposedly sinister forces that have lead to the lapse and prevent a return.\n\nAccording to scholar of fascism, Robert Paxton, it is not an ideology like others but understands itself as a political practice more than anything else:\n\n> In a way unlike the classical \"isms\", the rightness of fascism does not depend on the truth of any proposition advanced in its name. Fascism is \"true\" insofar as it helps fulfill the destiny of a chosen race or people or blood, locked with other peoples in a Darwinian struggle, and not in the light of some abstract universal reason. (...) The truth was whatever permitted the new fascist man (and woman) to dominate others, and whatever made the chosen people triumph.\n\n> Fascism rested not upon the truth of its doctrine but upon the leader's mystical union with historic destiny of his people. (...) The fascist leader wanted to bring his people into a higher realm of politics that they would experience sensually: the warmth of belonging to a race now fully aware of its identity, historic destiny, and power; the excitement of participating in a vast collective enterprise; the gratification of submerging oneself in a wave of shared feelings, and of sacrificing one's petty concerns for the group's good; and the thrill of domination. Fascism deliberate replacement of reasoned debate with immediate sensual experience transformed politics, as the exiled cultural critic Walter Benjamin was first to point, into aesthetics. And the ultimate fascist aesthetic experience, Benjamin warned in 1936, was war.\n\n> Fascist leaders made no secret of having no program. (...) Fascism radical instrumentalization of truth explains why fascists never bothered to write any casuistical literature when they changed their program as they did often and without compunction. Stalin was forever writing to prove that his policies accorded somehow with the principles of Marx and Lenin; Hitler and Mussolini never bothered with any such theoretical justification.\nIn the same vein, Paxton goes on to define Fascism as\n\n> a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victim-hood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.\n\nAs such, fascists have always resorted to the use of political violence, including the forceful overthrow of democracies and coup attempts. The Nazis for example were very good at instrumentalizing violence: Instigating street fights with communists as well as with Berlin police in the 1920s for example as a way to demonstrate that they were the most effective force in battling those perceived as the enemy while portraying the democratic state, its government and institutions as weak. \n\nSuch displays that both showed the force and strength of a fascist movement – show what they could do and inflict upon the system virtually without impunity was a classical and essential strategy in their rise to power for it portrayed them as strong, established them as a force to be afraid of and portrayed the democracitcinstill terror and fear in their opponents and in the middle class.\n\nHowever, something akin to what we have seen and continually see today means even more. Above Paxton mentions Benjamin and war as the ultimate aestehtic experience of fascism. By aesthetics Benajmin means to describe how politics is transformed into something resembling art, often putting immediate sensual experience over concrete content. Like viewing a Rembrandt or a Caravaggio, what is actually depicted becomes secondary over the experience of the beauty with which the motif is depicted.\nFascist politics share this trait by placing a larger emphasis on the ritual – masses, marches, book burnings, collective gatherings – rather than what is actually transported politically. For Nazis, it was not so much what Hitler said at some speech, it was how he said it – how he spoke, gesticulated, screamed – and how they experienced it – as part of a large crowd in a stadium, all acting in unison when screaming \"Heil\", wearing similar uniforms, marching in order etc. It is the experience of becoming part of a mass acting in a unified will; a community led by a single purpose; an intense feeling of belonging and becoming cog in a large machine of people that acts towards the ultimate goal of whatever you imagine deliverance to be.\n\nIn essence, it is swaying people to your political side not by argument or reason but giving them the intensive, almost lustful, experience of being part of something greater, a movement that will solve whatever ails them, of history, so to speak. And this is achieved through ritual, staging, and performance. Fascist mass politics do not rely on content or arguments but on this very performance and war – according to Benjamin – is portrayed and staged as the ultimate experience of all the above described feelings.\n\nBy displays of violence, Fascism seeks to transform politics from the – admittedly often skewed – exchange of ideas into an aesthetic experience itself: Aesthetic violence is the end point of fascist politics, not just its tool.\n\nIn order to understand what we have seen and continue to see today, it is imperative to understand that violence such as this is designed to serve Fascism in several ways: It disrupts democratic process and literally prevents the system from functioning; it helps portray the democratic state as ineffective and weak; it is designed to instill fear and terror in the hearts and minds of political opponents and the general populace; and it serves the deeply ingrained ideological need of fascists to engage in aesthe\tticized violence with such violence being designed to further fantasies of civil war, civic breakdown and – as Adolf Hitler wished it in 1945 – a Ragnarök like event of the world burning. This is what events like those today are designed for.\n\nLastly I’ll leave you with what Robert Paxton writes about Fascism and America:\n\n> The United States itself has never been exempt from fascism. (...) Much more dangerous [than movements like the American Nazi Party, which utilize already established tenants and creeds from Europe] are movements that employ authentically American themes in ways that resemble fascism functionally. The Klan revived in the 1920s, took on virulent anti-Semitism, and spread to the cities of the Middle West. In the 1930s, Father Charles E. Coughlin gathered a radio audience estimated at forty million around anti-communist, anti-Wall Street, pro-soft money, and – after 1938 – anti-Semtic message broadcast from his church in the outskirts of Detroit. (...) Today a \"politics of resentment\" rooted in authentic American piety and nativism sometimes leads to violence against some of the very same \"internal enemies\" once targeted by the Nazis, such as homosexuals and defenders of abortion rights.\n\n> Of course the United States would have to suffer catastrophic setbacks and polarization for these fringe groups to find powerful allies and enter the mainstream. I half expected to see emergence after 1968 a movement of national reunification, regeneration, and purification directed against hirsute antiwar protesters, black radicals, and \"degenerate\" artists. I thought that some of the Vietnam veterans might form analogs to the Freikorps of 1919 Germany and Itlaian Arditi, and attack youths whose demonstrations on the steps of the Pentagon had \"stabbed them in the back\". Fortunately, I was wrong (so far). (...)\n\n> The language and symbols of an authentic American fascism would, of course, have little to do with the original European models. They would have to be familiar and reassuring to loyal Americans as the language and symbols of the original fascism were familiar and reassuring to many Italians and Germans. (...) No swastikas in an American fascism, but Stars and Stripes (or Stars and Bars) and Christian corsses. No fascist salute, but mass recitation of the pledge of allegiance. These symbols contain no whiff of fascism in themselves, of course, but an American fascism would transform them into obligatory litmus tests for detecting the internal enemy.\"",

            "body": "To help provide context around the usurping of power and seditious acts, we can look to history to articulate a framework with which to evaluate contemporary situations and extrapolate comparisons. The circumstances leading to the attempted sedition today in Washington, D.C. beckons to an event that happened decades prior among the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation located in the state of South Dakota.\n\nIn the little town of Wounded Knee, located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, there was political takeover of the Tribal government by a man named Richard “Dick” Wilson. After a fraudulent election in 1972 in where he likely received aid from the United States federal government, he established a regime ripe with nepotism that oppressed inhabitants of the reservation. It was under this context that the Siege of Wounded Knee, later occurring 1973, would occur. But to understand how we would eventually end up with a modern-day siege of a town on an Indian reservation, we must examine what happened both prior to and during Wilson’s tenure.\n\nThe Pine Ridge Indian Reservation was established from the signing of the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868. It would later be partitioned into smaller sections in 1877, 1887, and 1889.\n\nFrom 1868 to the 1960s, Pine Ridge had undergone many hardships. Lands were stripped away, rations delivered to the reservation were cut, disease thrived, job opportunities evaporated, poverty was rampant, the socio-economic disparities skyrocketed, and hopeless abounded. In 1942, during World War II, the U.S. government expropriated approximately 1/8th of the northern part of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to use as a bombing range. They did this without the consent of the Sioux. After World War II, the land was not returned in full. This is because during the 50s/60s, uranium deposits were discovered among the same lands that had been taken. Some parts of these lands would be returned over the years, but not the full acreage. Many of the traditional Indians, those who committed to following their cultural lifestyles, started to agitate to move the federal government to return the land. However, their attempts would be rebuffed.\n\nBecause many of the traditional Indians were disenfranchised and disengaged from mainstream methods of redress, they found themselves in a weakened political position. They lacked the manpower and political power to continue the agitation and make any headway. It is from these circumstances that Richard “Dick” Wilson would come to notoriety. Dick Wilson was rather unknown Indian who descended from the Oglala. But when the agitation began among many of the Lakotas, the federal government moved to protect their interests. Wilson was installed as the chairman of the Tribe with the help of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Once in power, Wilson began appointing his own family members to serve as heads of Tribal departments such as housing, law enforcement and members of the Tribal council. Wilson was select because of a history of prior cooperation with federal authorities as an informant and tendency to undermine Tribal sovereignty in the name of self-interest.\n\nNot long after his “election,” the Tribe moved to impeach Wilson. Wilson then waged a campaign of intimidation and hostility to prevent his removal. Case in point: Wilson had orchestrated his own impeachment trial in where he presided over it and was subsequently acquitted of any crimes.\n\nIn the aftermath of his impeachment trial, Wilson began banning all perceived acts of dissent. Groups larger than 3 people were made illegal. He established his own GOON (Guardians of the Oglala Nation) squads to create political pressure and do his bidding. And he had full control over all legal and judicial means on the reservation. This is when the American Indian Movement (AIM) was called in. See, Wilson’s power stemmed from the creation of the Tribal government structure as articulated by the template constitutions of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. This system was rejected by traditionals on the reservation, but was acknowledged by the United States. Thus it was only this form of government that could act with any recognized authority.\n\nAfter the Siege of Wounded Knee in 1973, Wilson continued to exercise authority as chairman of the Tribe until losing an election 1976. By this time, the United States deprioritized policing American Indian actions as AIM and other elements of the Red Power Movement had been largely neutralized nationally. Yet, Wilson continued his suppression of dissonance well into 1975, including during the Jumping Bull Complex incident in where two FBI agents were killed. This involved the continued harassment and murder of dissidents and traditionals on the reservation and more than 50 AIM members.\n\nThese kinds of political usurptions and fractures are carried out under an ideology, one of oppression, control, and manipulation. They seek to polarize segments of the population in order to weaken cohesion and resolve. As in the case of Pine Ridge and Dick Wilson, outside elements are sometimes involved and the institutions we have in place are not only undermined, but attacked and destroyed. As a historian, it is times like these that give cause for reflection on the challenges we face and it is these narratives of history that we can observe to guide our steps moving forward.\n\n**Edit:** A word.\n\n**Sources**\n\nParts of this comment can be found among previous answers I've written [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5je4bc/in_1973_members_of_the_american_indian_movement/dbhtz6g/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7b79y8/ive_always_seen_makeshift_signs_saying_free/dpij02t/)",

If you're stuck on where to give, the [New Hanover County NAACP](https://www.nhcnaacp.org/) is a good place to start.\n\n**CONTENT WARNING**: This post includes racial slurs (used in historical context) and descriptions of sexual violence (imagined/real/and/or racist).  \n\nWilmington, North Carolina, is a place that is near and dear to my heart: it's a spot where I had my first post-graduate-school job, as a night news editor and then a features editor at the _Wilmington Morning Star_, later _Star-News_ and now the 4edgy5me _StarNews_, all one word. It's a place where I found myself loved up into being an adult by the generosity and friendliness of co-workers and neighbors, and also a place where I took my car to a body shop on Nigger Head Road. (By the early 2000s, the road had been officially renamed \"Negro Head,\" but locals used the earlier pronunciation.) \n\nNigger Head Road was so named because it was a spot where the remains -- often heads, but also other body parts, including but not limited to genitalia -- of Black citizens of Wilmington and the surrounding areas were displayed by white supremacists, to terrorize Black people into submission. This is in no way extraordinary; it is bog standard Southern city policy to do this sort of thing. \n\nThe _StarNews_ is the oldest surviving paper in North Carolina, although with a newsroom staff of about 3 now (compared with 65 or so in the early 2000s) its survival is fairly uncertain. \n\nIt is complicit in, and its editors when I was there struggled with the legacy of, the only municipal coup d'etat in American history. \n\nIn the 1760s/1770s, the people of Wilmington were as much a part of the revolutionary struggle as the people of Boston were, but a rather prominent American university in Cambridge, Mass. has told the tale of that time emphasizing the New Englanders' contributions. Being situated on the Cape Fear river, Wilmington is the only deepwater port in North Carolina, and became important to the Confederate government throughout the Civil War -- the capture of Ft. Fisher in January 1865 was followed by the occupation of Wilmington and the severing of the last supply lines to the traitor and enslaver Robert E. Lee's army, leading to their defeat and surrender at Appomattox Court House in April, 1865. \n\nIn 1860, Wilmington was a majority-Black city (though the majority of the Black people there were enslaved, there was a substantial free Black population in Wilmington) that contributed to its prosperity and success when the enslaved Black population was freed after 1865. Throughout the last decades of the 19th century, Wilmington continued to be a place that welcomed newly free Black people, and even elected them to office in large numbers -- of a population of 25,000 people in 1898, about 55 percent were Black. Three of the city's 10 aldermen were Black, 10 of 28 police officers were Black, and Black men and women made up about 30 percent of the city's skilled workers. \n\nTo quote from David Zucchino's book _Wilmington's Lie_: \n\n> There were black health inspectors, a black superintendent of streets, and far too many—for white sensitivities—black postmasters and magistrates. White men could be arrested by black policemen and, in some cases, were even obliged to appear before a black magistrate in court. Black merchants sold goods from stalls at the city’s public market—a rarity for a Southern town at the time. Black men delivered mail to homes at times of day when white women were unattended. They sorted mail beside white female clerks.\n\n> A black barber served as county coroner. The county jailer was black, and the fact that he carried keys to the lockup infuriated whites. The county treasurer was a black man who distributed pay to county employees, forcing whites to accept money from black hands. In 1891, President Benjamin Harrison had appointed a black man, John C. Dancy, as federal customs collector for the port of Wilmington. Dancy had replaced a white supremacist Democrat, and he drew an astonishing federal salary—$4,000 a year, or $1,000 more than the governor earned. A white newspaper editor ridiculed Dancy as “Sambo of the Custom House.”\n\n>Black businessmen pooled their money to form two small banks that loaned cash to blacks starting small businesses. Several black professionals ran small law firms and doctors’ offices, serving clients and patients of their own race. A black alderman from Raleigh, the capital, noted with some surprise that certain black men in Wilmington had built finely appointed homes with lace curtains, plush carpets, pianos, and even, he claimed, servants. The city’s thriving population of black professionals contradicted the white portrayal of Wilmington’s blacks as poor, ignorant, and illiterate. In fact, Wilmington’s blacks had higher literacy rates than virtually any other blacks in North Carolina, a state in which nearly a quarter of whites were illiterate.\n\n> For whites, this was an intolerable situation. The planters, lawyers, and merchants who had dominated Wilmington since its founding in 1739 had lost control of the city during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Through terror and intimidation by the night riders of the Ku Klux Klan, white supremacists had returned to power in the 1870s. They did not intend to surrender Wilmington again.\n\nThe Black population of Wilmington also had its own media -- brothers Alexander and Frank Manly published the _Wilmington Daily Record_, the only Black daily newspaper in the state. \n\nWilmington, being a port city, was always somewhat more cosmopolitan than the rest of the state, which by the 1890s was crawling with adherents to the first KKK, as well as other white supremacist groups, as well as people affected by the economic depression of 1892, who formed the Fusion Party (one of many) in North Carolina. The North Carolina \"Red Shirts\" were one such group; I'm sure that educated readers of this subreddit do not need me to make the comparison to the SA in pre-war Germany, but it exists.  \n\nBy the mid-1890s, the Fusion Party had elected both white and Black leaders to posts in the Carolinas, and set about dismantling gerrymandering and championing other Populist causes in the state, including tax reform. \n\nDemocratic leaders in North Carolina found this intolerable. In 1898, Furnifold Simmons, the newly elected Democratic Party chairman, decided the party would run on an issue that would cut across party lines (rail improvements) with a strategy that would appeal statewide (racial supremacy). His platform was summed up in these terms: \n\n> North Carolina is a WHITE MAN'S STATE and WHITE MEN will rule it, and they will crush the party of Negro domination beneath a majority so overwhelming that no other party will ever dare to attempt to establish negro rule here. \n\nN.C. Democratic party leader Daniel Scheck simplified the slogan: \n\n> It will be the meanest, vilest, dirtiest campaign since 1876. The slogan of the Democratic party from the mountains to the sea will be but one word ... 'Nigger'!\n\nIn the fall of 1898, \"White Supremacy Clubs\" were established throughout the state. Many prominent, semi-prominent, and poor white Wilmingtonians joined such clubs, often through choice but often through \"persuasion\" by their social betters, to fight against the bi-racial city government. The \"White Laborer's Union\", for example, advocated for the hiring of white men to replace Black men in skilled jobs. \n\nAnd then, the white people of Wilmington decided to use the old lie of Black men's sexual appetites to inflame things further. \n\nRebecca Latimer Felton, a women's suffragist, gave a speech in 1898 in which she asserted that black men raping white women was a problem that could only be solved by lynching (\"a thousand times a week if necessary\"). Again, this is not unusual for the time -- it's once again bog-standard white racism -- but Alexander Manly, of the aforementioned _Daily Record_, wrote an editorial in which he pointed out that many white women in fact had consensual sex with Black men. \n\nThis was the last straw for Democratic politicians and the Red Shirt paramilitary. The white supremacists statewide became enraged, and Democratic Wilmingtonian Alfred Waddell spoke at Thalian Hall in Wilmington on October 24, saying: \n\n> We will never surrender to a ragged raffle of Negroes, even if we have to choke the Cape Fear River with carcasses.\n\n(Thalian Hall is currently a lovely, restored art house cinema and community theater space.) \n\nAfter Waddell's speech in October, white supremacists from around the state traveled to a special White Supremacy Convention in Goldsboro, four days after Waddell's speech, in which he again repeated his call to violence. In ... events that parallel those of today's, the Red Shirt paramilitary left the convention and immediately started raiding the homes and businesses of Black men, women and children, intimidating them, whipping them, and in some cases killing them. \n\nBy Nov. 1, 1898, Mike Dowling (a former fireman who had been fired on charges of repeated drunkenness) was leading parades of up to 1,000 Red Shirts through Brooklyn (the Black neighborhood of Wilmington) with intent to intimidate black voters. These became daily occurrences. \n\nOn Nov. 7, 1868, the day before the election, Waddell spoke again at Thalian Hall, saying: \n\n> You are Anglo-Saxons. You are armed and prepared and you will do your duty ... Go to the polls tomorrow, and if you find the negro out voting, tell him to leave the polls and if he refuses, kill him, shoot him down in his tracks. We shall win tomorrow if we have to do it with guns. \n\n1/2",

            "body": "There have been many fantastic posts in this thread on the American historical background and parallels from modern history. I write this to add a perspective that is less directly relevant, but may be of interest: that of the oldest well-documented democracy in the world.\n\nAncient Athens saw its share of upheavals and political violence. Its society was riven with tension between rich and poor, citizen and migrant, city and country, old aristocracy and new money. For most of the 4th century BC - the time of Plato, Xenophon and Aristotle - the democracy was firmly established and stable, but it took a lot to get there. The long first century of democracy, 508-403 BC, saw at least 3 major attempts to overthrow the system of government.\n\nIn the Greek world, most attempts to seize power by force tended to take the same form: the seditious party would contrive an opportunity to gather in arms while their opponents were unarmed and off-guard, and seize control of all public spaces. Even invading armies would usually focus their attention on occupying market squares, temple precincts and government buildings. Why? Not only because control of these spaces meant control of the institutions, documents and ceremonies of state, but also because their occupation usually made it impossible for opponents to rally in defence. Greek states had no standing armies; if there was no advance warning, it could take hours, if not days, to assemble enough armed men to make a stand. To make things worse, there were rarely any other suitable spaces available to gather a militia or organise a crisis assembly, and the seizure of public buildings by the enemy made communication that much more difficult. An organised and armed force that controlled both the akropolis and the agora of a Greek state was effectively in control of that state.\n\nThe next move for the side staging the coup, besides assassinating prominent leaders of the opposition, was to force their way into the presiding council and dissolve the sitting bodies of government. Sometimes an intimidated assembly would be called to wave through the desired reforms. Other times the establishment of a new ruling council for day-to-day business was achieved by force.\n\nIn 411 BC, when Athenian fortunes in the Peloponnesian War were at their lowest, a conspiracy of oligarchs overthrew the democracy and established the rule of the Four Hundred. They did this through a series of disappearances and through intimidation of the Assembly, but the final installment of the Council of Four Hundred in place of the democratic Council was less subtle:\n\n> The Four Hundred arrived, each carrying a concealed dagger, accompanied by the 120 young men they used as their enforcers. They broke in on the regularly appointed councillors meeting in the council chamber and told them to take their pay and leave.\n\n-- Thucydides 8.69.4\n\nOn this occasion the councillors, thoroughly cowed, abandoned their seats, and Athenian democracy came briefly to an end. But a century earlier, when a faction of elite clans led by Isagoras tried to establish an oligarchy of 300, they had responded differently. \n\nIsagoras son of Teisandros was the chief rival of Kleisthenes, the man who introduced the reforms that established the Athenian democracy in 508 BC. Knowing that the battle for power in Athens was lost, Isagoras called on his Spartan friend, king Kleomenes (older half-brother of Leonidas) to help him strangle the new system in its crib. Kleomenes brought Spartan troops to Athens to back his coup. Again, the first to gather men in arms had the edge: Kleisthenes had to go into hiding, and Isagoras forced 700 families who supported Kleisthenes into exile. The next move was to dissolve the sitting council. Isagoras and his Spartan thugs marched on the council chamber under arms. But then something happened that some modern scholars see as the true birth of Athenian democracy:\n\n> The Council, however, resisted him, whereupon Kleomenes and Isagoras and his partisans seized the akropolis. The rest of the Athenians united and besieged them for two days. On the third day as many of them as were Lakedaimonians left the country under truce.\n\n-- Herodotos 5.72.2\n\n> But the Council resisted, and the people banded together, so the forces of Kleomenes and Isagoras took refuge in the Akropolis, and the people invested it and laid siege to it for two days. On the third day they let Kleomenes and his comrades go away under a truce, and sent for Kleisthenes and the other exiles to come back.\n\n-- Pseudo-Aristotle, *Constitution of the Athenians* 20.3\n\nAgainst all expectations, the council stayed true to its new role and refused to be intimidated. Then the people rose up - some of the earliest evidence for mass mobilisation in Athenian history. Instead of bowing to the new tyrant and his foreign muscle, they banded together and drove them out. THeir behaviour in this crisis would be a point of pride for the Athenian people for generations to come:\n\n> MEN'S CHORUS: Not even Kleomenes, the first to occupy this place, left here intact. No, for all he breathed the Spartan spirit, he left without his weapons - surrendering to me! - with only a little bitty jacket on his back, starving, filthy, unshaven, unwashed for six whole years.\n\n> MEN'S LEADER: That's the way I laid siege to that fellow - savagely! We camped before the gates in ranks seventeen deep. And now shall I stand by and do nothing to put down the effrontery of these women, enemies of all the gods and of Euripides?\n\n-- Aristophanes, *Lysistrata* 274-284",

            "body": "Remember the short film [Don’t Be a Sucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAu41SpYtl4)? It was making rounds right after the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally. If not, check it out.\n\nIt was one of many anti-racism/anti-bigotry efforts made by the US government, educational institutions, and anti-discrimination organizations (such as the Anti-Defamation League and the National Coalition of Christians and Jews). In many of these programs, pamphlets, and films, bigotry was portrayed as antithetical to American democracy. People espousing hatred were un-American.\n\nHere is the problem, if hatred was un-American, then where did it come from? In most cases during the late 1930s and 1940s, the answer was...fascism/Nazism. Go ahead and watch the 1944 film [Greater Victory](https://filmquarterly.org/2017/09/24/ten-intergroup-relations-films/) by the NCCJ. In it, two escaped Nazi POWs seek to undermine Americans in a small town. Explaining German strategy to one of their relatives, they expressed that Germany would win in the end. Even in dire circumstances for Germany of 1944, they believed in ultimate victory. Why? Because they had a secret weapon. Hatred.\n\nOne of the escaped Nazis stated, “It’s so easy. First, we \\[Germany\\]make them hate the Jews. Then we make them hate the Catholics. Then we make them hate the Protestants. And when they’re all so busy fighting each other, we’ll take over…It worked in Belgium, Austria, France, and it will work here.” He argued that “we Germans have spent years planting our ideas here. Race hatred, religious antagonism, class hatred.”\n\nMost of these anti-racism texts had some sort of similar statement or message. Bigotry wasn’t American. Bigotry was Nazi.\n\nThe consequence, though not the intent, was that once Germany was defeated, the push for anti-bigotry lost its power. If the Nazis were no longer around to subvert the United States, then there was no bigotry. At least, not any of domestic origin.\n\nSoon, conservative Americans began to see those who were speaking out about bigotry as causing the very type of racial antagonism which the Nazis had utilized. To conservatives, speaking out about bigotry, not the bigotry itself, threatened American unity and weakened the country. They, too, recognized foreign influence in this divisiveness. But they didn’t accuse fascism. Instead, they saw anti-racism efforts as Soviet subversion.\n\nTake for example Mary Riley, a conservative Catholic woman working in the New York City Board of Education. She undermined and, ultimately, ended an intercultural education program for continued teacher training. The reason? She believed that it was sponsored by communists wishing to undermine American unity through promoting racial antagonism. She opposed the program’s statements criticizing the likes of rabid anti-semite Father Coughlin. When one member of an Advisory Committee on Human relations presented a plan of procedure to deal with an “un-American” incident involving two teachers, and likely dealing with anti-semitism, Riley called for a more “complete” definition of un-American. She argued that “class against class is as fascistic as pitting religion against religion and race against race. Hitler in Germany and left-wingers in New York City use the same technique, namely, “Divide and conquer,” for here as in Europe the Jew versus Catholic propaganda is creating a split in the population through which the anti-Americans will enter and take over.” In other words, anyone speaking out against inequality was suspect of un-American, communist (but Nazi-like) subversion of the country.\n\nThis line of thinking, that racial antagonism was foreign and communist, would become a staple of segregationist defenses. The UN Declaration of Human Rights was viewed as an attempt to stir up racial conflict in the South through enforcing the end of segregation and anti-miscegenation laws. The NAACP’s efforts to desegregate schools were linked to communism and a global (read Jewish) conspiracy.\n\nWhat does all this mean?\n\nThere is going to be a lot of discussion about the insurrection against American democracy today. It signifies, among numerous other things, the power of rhetoric and language in shaping ideas and principles. As you should know, this did not occur by accident. Instead, through a systematic manipulation of rhetoric on social media, President Trump and his supporters have encouraged a viewpoint that rejects the possibility of defeat and responds through an escalation of force. This resulted, when defeats multiplied, in the perceived necessity of a violent assault on American democracy.\n\nWords have power.With this in mind, I want to encourage you to think about the words you use in discussing this event. Particularly, the analogies you draw. Already I have heard news broadcasts stating that this type of thing is like a “Third World” country, “not America”. The already popular Yallqaeda is going to spread like wildfire throughout social media. President-elect Joe Biden just stated that this is not who Americans are.\n\nWe must push back against these symbols and statements that suggest that this type of action is not ingrained in American history and culture. Americans have long harbored and accepted undemocracy. As long as the “right people” had access to democracy. For all of American history, those on the margins have fought, and often died, for the right to participate. And along the way, many already within the system have fought them.\n\nThroughout US history, those considered “American” have fought to keep women from individual rights, blacks from voting, Latinx from equal citizenship, and Native Americans from their land. Violence and the threat of force, judicial or extrajudicial, has always been a tool in the hands of those claiming that they, and they alone, define who “real” Americans are.Why does it matter that people use analogies comparing this event to a “third world coup attempt”? Why should we care if we call MAGA supporters Yallqaeda? Because this isn’t something we learned and it isn’t the first time Americans have used and threatened political violence.\n\nWhat do we call this, then? What is it like? This is Christian Nationalism. This is domestic fascism. This is the States Rights Party. This is the KKK. This is the Confederacy.\n\nLet’s try to avoid easy analogies that elide the long-running history of the American infatuation with violent control over the political process by vigilantism. Because if we don’t recognize that this is built into who we are as a nation, then we cannot fully commit to the difficult process that is exorcising it.\n\nInstead, make direct analogies and comparisons to events in US history that trace the connection between the racism, misogyny, bigotry, etc. of this country’s history and the events today.\n\nIt is not for no reason that the protesters set up a gallows today.\n\nIt is not for no reason that these protesters carry Confederate flags.\n\nIt is not for no reason that they cry “America First”.\n\nUnfortunately, this event is very much in the spirit of, ironically, those who have historically most shouted “Americanism” from the rooftops. That spirit must be smothered.\n\nFortunately, America also has a history of another spirit. One in which many of those already with power have come alongside those already heroically fighting for their rights. A spirit exemplified in the Civil War, in the Double V campaign, in the Civil Rights Movement, and continuing to this day.\n\nWe need to decry the part of America that sees what happened today and celebrates just as we celebrate the part of it that seeks to be better. Be more equitable. Be an America worthy of celebration rather than one demanding it.\n\nFor more on domestic fascism, American cultural memory of Nazism, and education, see this [AH Conference panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9HqeP_OSAw&list=PLgMy8FV2sLlWLVRdxil9pEleJDu7OlQD2&index=5) ( I speak  at minutes 12:10-22:25 and then the Q&A at the end) some of my answers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jwibyk/in_the_1960s_texas_passed_a_law_criminalizing_the/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/j293fv/during_wwii_there_were_americans_who_were_both/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gm7pr7/why_was_it_official_us_policy_not_to_use_the_word/).",

            "body": "The aim of this META post is to help provide some historical perspective on coups, how they failed, how they succeeded, and help put the events on the grounds of the US Capitol Building  into a bit more historical perspective. /u/indyobserver has done a *fantastic* job kicking this off with the a chronicle of some past events in the United States, while mods and flairs are offering a variety of examples that run the gamut, some focusing on conceptual things, others more on specific examples. I have a few options I feel I could draw on, although in the end I decided I'd share an episode that perhaps doesn't have *direct* parallels, but is an exciting story of a North America country, facing distress, with foreign interference to boot.\n\n**Background**\n\nGeneral Porfirio Díaz had risen to power in Mexico, and ruled continually as President since 1884. We're rating on the scale of \"He's a goddamn dictator, OK?\", but the early years don’t seem to have been too bad, as far as dictators go. The economy was good, and the country was stable - not a very common thing in Mexican history of the 19th century. But of course, nothing lasts forever. The growth was at the expense of the peasantry, who grew more and more upset at Díaz, and the many in the middle class resented the more and more repressive nature of the government.\n\nTime passes, and with the 1910 “elections” coming up, Díaz implies that not only is he maybe ready to hang up his hat and retire, but that he believes Mexico is even ready to choose his successor through actual democratic elections! Francisco Madero, a vocal opponent of the Díaz regime, was undoubtedly the strongest candidate, being both an advocate of reform, but friendly to the Mexican elite whose support was essential to triumph in an election. Díaz, deciding maybe Mexico wasn’t ready to be out from under his thumb, reneged on his promise and put his name on the ballot, running for what would be his eighth term as President. When it became apparent that Madero wasn’t simply going to be a foil to give his re-election legitimacy, but rather was a candidate who might *win*, Díaz had his opponent thrown in jail during the election, and the published result of at the polls showed Díaz winning in a landslide, despite the fact that everyone knew Madero has much popular support.\n\nMadero’s family had enough connections to quickly see him released on bail. He fled Mexico City the first chance he got, and declared himself to be the real, legitimate President of Mexico. After a brief stop in the US to arrange for support and arms, he began his campaign to topple Díaz in February, 1911. While some of the forces who flocked to his banner were loyal to him specifically (*Maderistas*), he was something of a rallying point for all types of anti-Díaz sentiment, and two of the most notable commanders to join under his umbrella were Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa, the former of whom was representative of much of the most radical calls for land reform coming from the Mexican peasantry. Another supporter whose name will be important later was Venustiano Carranza.\n\nThanks to the assistance, Díaz didn’t really stand all that much of a chance. Within only a few days of each other in May, the Maderistas and their allies made quick work of the Federales at Cuautla (led by Zapata) and Ciudad Juarez (Madero and Villa teaming up). The Treaty of Ciudad Juarez followed within days, sending Díaz into exile, and placing setting Madero up to ascend to the Presidency (there would be an interim President until the elections, which Madero was assured to win, which he did, taking office in November).\n\n**Seeds of Revolt**\n\nSo by the end of 1911, Madero was now in power, and he proceeded to kind of make a mess of things. On the one hand, he wasn’t a *bad* leader. Compared to life under Díaz, he oversaw a pretty unprecedented level of civil freedoms in Mexico, and to his credit, he did try to be a progressive reformer. Many praised him for introducing the beginnings of democracy to Mexico. But in trying to be moderate, and gradual in his reforms he kind of wanted to please everyone, and instead he he ended up pleasing no one. The far left elements, principally the *Zapatistas*, had wanted radical changes, which Madero didn’t bring about. It didn’t help that he was still one of the wealthiest citizens in the country. They were quickly alienated and Zapata decided to continue his Revolution as before. Another ally, Pascual Orozco, also was dissatisfied and started his own revolt. \n\nOutside of the country, he enjoyed little love from foreign governments, most notably that of the United States. The Taft administration was generally cool towards the new Madero government, but American Ambassador to Mexico Henry Lane Wilson was especially hostile, and routinely did everything he could to portray Madero in the worst light when sending dispatches to Washington. He believed that Madero brought instability to the country, hurting American business interests, unlike the state of things under Díaz.\n\nNow at this point Madeo made what was probably the most fatal mistake. Instead of purging the Army and putting his *Maderistas* into the key positions, he foolishly decided to trust the Army to be professional. Most of his men were demobilized and sent home. Those who wished to remain under arms could either join the *Rurales* (Gendarmerie), or a small number could be folded into the *Federales* (Federal Army). As such, in the ranks of the Army those who had joined during the Díaz era outnumbered Madero loyalists two to one, with the bloated officer corps especially of questionable loyalty. Which was, to say the least, problematic for Madero’s long term survival. While on the one hand he had lost the support of many allies for not going far enough in his reforms, much of the Army was unhappy with what he had nevertheless done!\n\nPerhaps the most unhappy figure, as we will see, was General Victoriano Huerta. He had, at least in appearance, thrown his loyalties in with the new administration and was tasked with suppressing the Orozco revolt, only to then get in a huff and enter semi-retirement after having a falling out with Madero over the President’s refusal to reward him for his successes, leaving a great deal of mutual dislike between the two. Aside from the quietly stewing Huerta, there were two major attempts to overthrow Madero’s government, both in the previous year, one in Veracruz led by General Félix Díaz (nephew of the former dictator), and the other by General Bernadro Reyes, who had been a figure under Díaz, but at least temporarily gave Madero a chance. Both attempts failed, and the Generals found themselves imprisoned in Mexico City.\n\n**The Uprising**\n\nEvents came to a head on February 8th, 1913 at the instigation of a *Felicista* (support of Félix Díaz), General Manuel Mondragón. After planning and preparing for some time, and bringing a corps of officers in the Army to his side, Mondragón called on the Cadets at the ~~Heroic Military College~~ Military School at Tlalpan to join him in an uprising against the Madero government. About 600 or so cadets joined him, making up the initial core force. They marched on the prison holding Díaz, and secured his release, followed shortly after by the release of Reyes. Bolstered by additional numbers from the Army who sided with the plotters, Reyes marched on the National Palace the next morning, only to be met by an unexpectedly stout defense, led by General Lauro Villar, on the part of Madero loyalists. Reyes was cut down in the assault, leaving Díaz as the sole leader of the revolt.\n\nUpon hearing of the uprising, Madero, who lived away from the city center, jumped on horseback and rode for the National Palace. Escorting him, it should be noted, were a small group of cadets from the Heroic Military College, an event they still celebrate as The Loyalty March. Nearing the palace and slowed by the crowds, he paused in his trip to give a speech from a balcony to the assembled people, assuring him that the uprising would quickly be put down. Meeting up with him at this point was the inactive Gen. Huerta, who offered to assist Madero. Although Madero didn’t like him, he nevertheless put Huerta in command of the city forces, as the previous commander had been injured defending the palace shortly before.\n\nBy that next morning, it seemed like Madero had the situation under control. Díaz was still alive and kicking, but the Army was getting reinforced from outside the city, and the *Felicistas* were holed up in the the city arsenal, known as the Ciudadela. In an attempt to root them out, Gen. Huerta subjected it to significant artillery bombardments, and repeatedly charged their positions (more on this later). Lots of civilian casualties resulted from the cannonade that Huerta subjected the *Felicista* position to.\n\n1/2",

            "body": "Fascist movements rely on the perception of popularity, the sense of a mass movement determined to sweep away the fragile trappings of liberal democracy, to expose the perceived weakness and lack of determination at the heart of the system. This process is inherently violent – not just towards the political system, but those who support it, defend it and ultimately those who were once protected by it.\n\nFascist movements succeed not because they are actually strong enough to achieve this, but because they convince those who are strong enough to defend democracy that it is not in their best interests to do so. That they are better allies than enemies, that their supposed popularity and dynamism offers a lifeline to conservative movements becoming keenly aware that the march of history is against them. That their opponents – usually leftist politicians and political movements, but in every case those framed as the true enemies of the nation – are the real threat against which fascist aid and protection is vital. It’s a long con, the goal of which is majority complicity in an ever-escalating cycle of abuse. \n\nFascist movements don’t succeed when there is a refusal to compromise with them across the political spectrum, when standing and defending democracy is not the task of a demonised minority, and above all when conservatives realise in time that they do not and cannot control the movements whose support seems, in the short-term, to be oh-so-convenient. For those on the left who are cynical that this might be possible, I’d remind them that the largest war in the history of the human race was fought, and won, by an anti-fascist coalition that brought together conservatives, liberals, socialists and many others, who learned just in time to put aside their differences to confront what they correctly recognised to be an existential threat.\n\nHistory offers explanations, not neat parallels. 1922, 1923, 1933 or 1936, to name a few in my own field of study, do not hold all the answers we need today, or offer a roadmap to a better future. The roots of what we’ve witnessed lie not in Germany, Italy or other European countries that fell to fascism from within, but rather – as argued persuasively above – in America itself. \n\nFor more detail (and sources) on these dynamics, and how they were successfully and unsuccessfully resisted during the 1930s and 1940s, these longer posts on [political violence](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/c9nds3/historical_opposition_to_facism/), [fascism](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bbke3j/as_far_as_i_know_the_antifascist_movement_began/) and [anti-fascism](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/au4suv/were_there_any_notable_successful_or_nearly/eh5yzgy/?context=3) that may be of interest.",

In Spain we have had a hilariously high number of coups in the 19th century, but we don't need to go that far back in order to see the last coup attempt.\n\nFebruary the 23rd of 1981 was an important day. It would have been the day when Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo would be appointed prime minister by the Congreso de los Diputados (Chamber of Representatives). But things did not follow the ordinary course of events that day. \n\nBeing the type of session that it was, all of the 350 members of Congress were present that day, as they would have to vote on making Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo the new president of the Council of Ministers. President Adolfo Suárez had resigned some type before, so there had to be a session for appointing a new president of the council. The boring part had taken place a few days earlier, with the standard parliamentary debates on government programs and all that jazz. The Congress did not have much to do but to vote yes or no on Calvo-Sotelo's appointment. That would, however, take a lot of time. For the voting session for appointing a new PM, the president of the Congress calls each MP in alphabetic order, and they have to say, loud and clear \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nAnd then, the thing most people in Spain dreaded simply happened: a coup. A platoon of civil guards stormed the Congress under the command of lieutenant-colonel Antonio Tejero, taking the whole government and parliament hostage.\n\nMany people in Spain started packing their stuff and getting ready to go to Portugal or to France fearing another dictatorship. My own parents were among those people, getting ready to go back to Rennes where they had been living for four years until 1977, when my father decided to come back to Spain profitting from the Amnesty Law. My father, prior to deciding definitely to move to France called one of his cousins, who at that time was a general in the Military House of the King, and was reassured that the coup could not succeed. This guy's brother was in Brunete, and had seen general Torres Rojas arrested for trying to usurp the command of the División Acorazada Brunete. Not everyone had the capacity of making such calls.\n\nThe government was taken hostage, and the parliament was held hostage too. When the civil guards stormed the Chamber holding rifles and Lt.-colonel Tejero fired a few rounds to the air, just about all of the MPs cowered in their seats, except three: president Adolfo Suárez, who was all out of fucks to give, general Gutiérrez Mellado who had seen it all, and Santiago Carrillo the general secretary of the Communist Party who was in Suárez's very state of mind. Carrillo, of course, while not stopping smoking his trusted Dunhills.\n\nI'll leave here a link to Radio Televisión Española with material about the 23F coup attempt through the eyes of some of the protagonists\nhttps://www.rtve.es/noticias/23f/",

            "body": "/u/indyobserver 's overview mentions Bleeding Kansas as one of our lamentable precedents. This is one episode from there:\n\nIn the spring of 1855, the territory of Kansas had a problem: enslaving. That was also a problem the United States as a whole had had for as long as a United States existed to have problems. The issue, specifically, was whether the United States would continue to be a white supremacist ethnostate bent on the genocide of Native Americans and the stealing of the lives, labor, and loved ones of Black Americans through a regime of torture, terror, and rape, or if it would set down a path for only doing the former. This greatly aroused the passions of white Americans, who, whilst nigh-unanimous on white supremacy and genocide now increasingly divided over whether or not enslaving black Americans represented a threat to their own freedom and prosperity or whether it was the source of that freedom and prosperity.\n\nThe issue boiled over in Kansas because proslavery forces successfully forced the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, which banned slavery there, with the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. That act also opened Kansas to white colonization, which immediately led to the question of whether or not enslaving was allowed in the new territory. Said new territory happened to be directly adjacent to Missouri's most-enslaving region and its enslavers, including David Rice Atchison who had played a critical role in the Missouri Compromise repeal *and* who was then up for re-election. Atchison is an obscurity most famous for a false trivia item now, but he was one of the most powerful Senators of the 1850s and close allies with several others. \n\nThe Missouri Compromise was repealed on the theory that American democracy could decide the slavery question without the terrible stresses to the white Union involved in American democracy deciding it on the national state. The legislators declared that the good white men of Kansas could sort it for themselves, with Atchison at their forefront. Atchison then declared that white Kansans were not fit for that and would need help from their enslaving and enslaver-friendly neighbors in Missouri, who came across the border in loosly-organized mobs when Kansas held elections and animated by the theory that rich New England Yankees had funded an army of paupers to run into Kansas and vote slavery out, then promptly go home and/or become an antislavery militia crossing the border to undermine Missourian enslaving. Those paupers would steal the elections by illegal voting to make Kansas a hotbed of ablitionism and that theft must be stopped, so they were told in pamphlets and rallies across Missouri's plantation belt, many organized out of Masonic lodges.\n\nSo the mobs came, with some in the pay of local enslavers, group rates negotiated for ferry transit, some alcohol provided, and guns and bowie knives supplied by the mob themselves. They coordinated who went where, fanning out to all of Kansas' polling places so that they, not actual Kansan colonists, could vote in the elections to form the territory's first legislature. Across the territory antislavery Kansans got the drift quickly: if they tried to vote against the proslavery ticket they'd be mobbed, roughed up, and maybe killed. Many turned and left. Some dared the mob, one claiming he would vote proslavery received a crowd-surfing boost over the throng...until someone saw the antislavery ticket in his hand. Threats of beheading circulated with the brandished guns and knives. Proslavery men shot at fleeing antislavery voters. Election officials were intimidated and forced to resign in favor of the mob's nominees.\n\nAt Bloomington, the proslavery men seem to have lacked some of the confidence they had elsewhere, or maybe they found angrier, more stubborn Kansans. Either way, they came a bit late and for as much as an hour on election morning Kansans voted there unmolested. Then the three to seven hundred proslavery militants arrived and found the election being held at a log cabin, with the officials inside and votes taken through a window. Doing their duty, the judges of the election permitted them to vote...on the grounds that they swear an oath to being lawful Kansans with intent to reside permanently in the territory.\n\nA man called Samuel Jones stepped forward and told the officials that the mob had come from Missouri to vote, to make Kansas a slave state. But this oath stuff? Forget it. The judges would then not take votes from them. Kansans, who had been hanging about the voting window socializing -elections were a bit social event in the 19th century- then decided that the Missourians had been taken care of and tried to vote. The mob seized them and pulled them away. Then they demanded the election officials resign so the mob could appoint their own and the violence went to a new level.\n\nThe judges refused, at which point the mob swore that if the judges didn’t reconsider they would tear down the cabin and kill them, or at least blow their brains out. One of the election clerks estimated a dozen pistols cocked and aimed when the threat was given, all through that window. They were brandished at least eight times, perhaps as many as a dozen.The mob charged the window and smashed the glass and frame. Then they jammed logs under the corners of the cabin to make levers and tried to literally shake the building down on the judges’ heads. They had another log coming up to ram the door in. \n\nOne judge bolted, seizing the ballot box and fleeing with a “hurrah” for Missouri rather than being the intersection point for what he estimated to be around a hundred bullets. That left the door open and the mob rushed within, guns and knives out and ready. Jones took the lead as they filled the cabin, at least six or eight men in tight quarters with two remaining judges and a pair of clerks. Jones drew out his pocket watch and told the judges they could resign or they could die. They had five minutes to decide. Other guns and knives stood at the ready, trained on the embattled officials.\n\nOutside, as all this happened, John Wakefield had been recognized by some in the mob as the local antislavery candidate. The Missourian mob leaned on him to lean on the judges. Wakefield declined. A minute into their five-minute ultimatum, the two remaining judges of the election came out to consult with him on what to do.Jones let them go outside on the grounds that they would come back with an answer. Wakefield told them that they should retire to one of the judges’ homes, three hundred yards away, and write up a statement of what happened.\n\nThe trio got to the judge’s house, but they were spotted and a part of the mob followed after, mounted, and demanded the poll books from the judges within. In the interim one judge had fled with them, hoping to deny the Missourians vital documents to certify their theft of the election. The judge had passed off the books, but the Missourians mistook the man who he’d given them to for him and got them all the same. Books in hand they returned to the judge’s house for an armed standoff with Wakefield training a borrowed double-barreled shotgun at Jones and Jones’ mob. Things stood that way for a few tense minutes until Wakefield was persuaded that he might take a few Missourians with him, but upwards of twenty people now sheltered in the judge’s home and none of them were armed. If gunplay ensued, they weren’t getting out of it. \n\nWakefield surrendered and Jones’ men took him back to the main crowd, insisting he tell them that he had nothing to do with influencing the election. That was true, so Wakefield had no problem getting up in a wagon and saying it. While there, surrounded by armed and angry men, he also dressed them down as an American and veteran of two wars. He and his fellow free staters were abused unjustly and this mob was a walking repudiation of the constitution of the United States. He did this all to cries of “Shoot him! He is too saucy!”\n\nThe mob’s ringleaders promised Wakefield his safety for the declaration he gave, if not the patriotic denunciation after it. He called on them to remember that pledge, which they begrudgingly did now that they had everything else they wanted. One insisted on tying a white ribbon to Wakefield’s lapel to mark him as a friend to the mob. Wakefield cut it off as soon as he could and tried to leave. The triumphant Missourians decided to let him vote. Wakefield refused to lend their coup any legitimacy and left.\n\nThe Missourians carried the day, stealing Kansas’ elections and thus its legislature. The fruit of their assault upon a citadel of democracy came in passing a draconian set of laws that criminalized any form of antislavery activism or speech in the territory and barred from office any man, however elected, who would not swear himself to the preservation of slavery.",

It took place in Wilmington, NC, in 1898. The coup was accomplished by white supremacists who took power in what was an integrated community with a thriving black middle class . The insurrectionists literally marched up to the mayor and aldermen and forced them to resign at gunpoint. The next day, they installed a new mayor and aldermen. They burned businesses and homes. They drove out thousands, and killed an untold number but average estimates are a couple of hundred.  All of this took place and when those affected appealed to local and Federal authorities, no one did anything about it. The response was often simply \"You should have known your place.\"\n\nThere was also the Battle of Athens, in Athens TN in 1946. This one is looked upon more favorably by history because it involved the opposite of Wilmington: this was an armed group attempting to make sure votes in an election were properly counted. There was an election in Athens, TN, and on the ballot was the replacement of several corrupt local officials. When the election was over, the ballots were taken to be counted in the jail in secret by several of these corrupt officials who also happened to have seats on the local board of elections. Thus, they could certify the election results themselves and no one would ever see them. So those opposing these officials, mostly (perhaps all, I can't recall) former GIs who had fought in WW2, seized weapons from the local armory and besieged the jail. They won the battle, seized the ballots, and had them counted with officials from other jurisdictions present. The GI slate triumphed, the corrupt officials were deposed, and GIs never faced legal consequences. Nor did the corrupt officials they defeated both at the ballot box and in the battle. The good guys won. We think.",
